It features an engaging gameplay loop with satisfying combat and loot systems, offering a wide appeal to various types of gamers. The game\'s narrative is built around a single-player campaign, serving primarily as a gate to unlock features and expand the map. Improved multiplayer accessibility is seen in the PC version, although the tutorial and grouping up with friends might take some time to get used to.\n\nThe game\'s sound effects are noteworthy, and the graphics and art design are impressive, with detailed monsters, lush environments, and quality animations. The performance on PS4 Pro can reach 60fps in 4K with some settings adjusted, while the PC version has minor pop-in issues during graphically intensive cutscenes. The new verticality of levels occasionally leads to frustrating AI pathing glitches.\n\nThe most mentioned topics in the reviews are \"Fun Monster Hunting\" and \"Great Monster Hunter Game - Fun and Addictive,\" highlighting the game\'s success in delivering an enjoyable monster hunting experience. Some issues with AI pathing and end-game difficulty spikes exist, but overall, Monster Hunter: World is a highly recommended game for MMO fans, action fans, RPG fans, and open-world fans who enjoy combat and loot systems.','{\"0\":{\"name\":\"Fun Monster Hunting\",\"freq\":2},\"-1\":{\"name\":\"Great Monster Hunter Game - Fun and Addictive\",\"freq\":1}}'),(5,'Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world, action-adventure RPG set in the megalopolis of Night City, where you play as a cyberpunk mercenary wrapped up in a do-or-die fight for survival.

Exploring the galaxy and discovering new planets is a novel experience. The game features role-playing, crafting, and various ways to approach scenarios. However, the main story is criticized for its shallow storytelling, weak writing, and uninspired narrative. The RPG mechanics are also superficial, particularly in dialogue and quest solutions. The skill tree system requires commitment to unlock more interesting abilities, and it can be challenging to access more advanced skills.\n\nThe game\'s performance on Xbox Series X and PC has occasional issues, including dips in frame rate, save file corruption, model and texture pop-in, occasional crashes, performance slowdowns, and other minor bugs. However, these issues do not significantly hinder game progression.\n\nOverall, while Starfield offers a fun space exploration experience, it falls short in delivering a compelling vision of humanity\'s future in space and an engaging main story. The game has more negative reviews than positive ones, suggesting a disappointing experience for many players.','{\"0\":{\"name\":\"Fun Space Exploration\",\"freq\":2},\"-1\":{\"name\":\"Disappointing experience with too much repetition\",\"freq\":2}}'),(9,'Every day, millions of players worldwide enter battle as one of over a hundred Dota heroes.

Thanks to Bethesda’s refusal to send review copies to multiple UK websites, seemingly in an attempt to manipulate the Metacritic score prior to launch, we’ve been playing catch-up. We’ve avoided reading any reviews, but we have seen the general reaction, which is understandably mixed.\n\nThat lack of agreement is not because Starfield’s failures and accomplishments are particularly nuanced, it’s more how willing you are to put up with its many foibles. What complicates Starfield’s evaluation is its status as Microsoft’s most import first party release in a generation, with many Xbox and Bethesda fans having convinced themselves of its excellence long before they had a chance to play it for themselves.\n\nIn trying to look at the game objectively it’s an experience that’s hard to feel passionate about one way or another. Despite its many and obvious failings, it’s not a disaster. Instead, it’s main problem is that, at a conceptual level, it’s not nearly different enough from Skyrim and Fallout to take full advantage of the outer space setting. It’s trying to be two completely different games at once and, predictably, it fails to do either particularly well.\n\nWe’ve already previewed Starfield, and started a review in progress, so between that and the game’s general ubiquity at the moment, it feels as if it needs no introduction. And yet the central disappointment of the game is the huge gap between what people thought it was going to be, when all the slickly edited gameplay trailers were doing the rounds, and what it actually is.\n\nStarfield is, for better and worse, Skyrim in space. Or rather Fallout in space, since both games involve guns and have you spending an awful lot of your time litter-picking, to use your collected bric-a-brac for crafting. You can explore space and get into dogfights, but this never feels like more than an aside, as if it was dropped into the game relatively late in its design.\n\nWe don’t think it was but the fundamental problem with Starfield is that it doesn’t fully commit to its premise. Rather than space exploration being at the game’s core it’s merely window-dressing for Bethesda’s familiar ground-based action role-playing. Except, instead of a single open world, densely packed with secrets and side quests, everything in Starfield is spread out across a whole virtual galaxy, with many planets having nothing of interest to discover.\nBeyond Bethesda’s previous work, the two obvious influences on Starfield are No Man’s Sky and Mass Effect. The former comes from a long tradition of British-made space exploration games, stretching back to the early 80s, almost all of which allowed you to seamlessly fly between space and a planet and yet, incredibly, Starfield does not. Here, space is one open world and each planet surface is another, with the only connection between them being cut scenes and loading screens.\n\nThat’s such an off-puttingly restrictive way of doing things it’s baffling that the game ever got past the design stage with that decision intact. Not only does it mean there’s no planetside flight, but there’s almost nothing to do in your ship beyond space combat. And while getting into a dogfight is fun at first it never evolves beyond its first principles and quickly becomes a sideshow.\n\nRather than feeling like an explorer or dangerous space pirate, questing amongst the stars, all travel is handled on a dull little map screen, your destination chosen automatically by just selecting a mission from a list.\n\nThat’s not the only thing that runs on autopilot, as your ship computer seems to have read the game script ahead of time, as it always knows exactly where to send you before you or it could ever possibly know. Waypoint markers appear the instant a subject is brought up, and often beforehand, with no need to think or look for anything yourself.\n\nThat sort of approach works well enough for Rockstar Games but the problem with Starfield’s missions is how unforgivably dull they are. This is partly a mechanical problem, given that the movement system and combat is mediocre and the artificial intelligence weak (laughably so for your allies, who vacillate between hyperactive and utterly disinterested).\n\nAlthough the story missions are incredibly repetitive (we’ll get to the story later) the side quests are impressively varied and unpredictable. For example, there’s one set on a luxury liner in space where you’re trying to get the login details of a bank executive, either because you’re an actual pirate or you’re just pretending to be one as a mole for the military.','2023-12-23 14:59:21.259000','Latest',_binary '\0',6,-1,'2024-03-20 10:26:07.634000','2024-03-20 10:26:23.434000',5,8,12,NULL,'STEAM',2400,_binary '\0','2024-03-20 10:26:05.729000','{\"Overall\":[\"disappointing attempt\",\"many foibles\"],\"Accessibility\":[\"not very accessible\",\"tedious travel\",\"unintuitive combat and movement\"],\"Sound\":[\"NA\"],\"Graphics & Art Design\":[\"NA\"],\"Suggestion\":[\"improved AI\",\"varied missions\",\"less restrictive travel system\"],\"Gameplay\":[\"mediocre combat\",\"weak AI\",\"repetitive missions\",\"varied side quests\",\"dull map screen\",\"automatic waypoint markers\"],\"Narrative\":[\"serviceable story\",\"unpredictable side quests\",\"not heavily focused\"],\"Bug\":[\"NA\"],\"Price\":[\"NA\"],\"isSpam\":false,\"Performance\":[\"NA\"]}','The gameplay of Starfield is a mix of Skyrim and Fallout set in space, but has mediocre movement, combat, and weak AI.

I had to engage, provoke, and eventually befriend the international con artists all while I watched my FIA (Cyberpunk future CIA)-provided funds dwindle away⁠. Shoulda bet on black. At the last minute I chose a particularly inflammatory and insulting dialogue option and my handler pre-emptively chewed me out over the radio, but the little freaks absolutely ate it up. Maybe I am cut out for this superspy stuff.\n\nPhantom Liberty is an extra-refined bite of Cyberpunk 2077—an expansion pack\'s expansion pack. It doesn\'t reinvent the game as a whole, but it\'s a fantastic final outing for V and Night City, as well as one of the best individual stories CD Projekt Red has told to date. Meanwhile, Cyberpunk 2077\'s 2.0 update, free to all players, has reforged the original looter shooter gear deluge and \"+5% poison resistance\"-style perks system, giving us a more solid RPG whose under-the-hood systems better compliment its shooting, slashing, and stealthing.\n\nAfter a legendarily fraught launch and three years of rebuilding, Cyberpunk 2077 is finally the RPG its world and characters deserved, and Phantom Liberty is a fine last hurrah for a game that\'s taken CD Projekt so long to hone.\n\nIt took me a second to come around to Phantom Liberty\'s set-up: rescue the president of the New United States after Space Force One (lol) gets shot down over Dogtown, a newly added district of Night City that looks like the Thunderdome by way of Blade Runner: 2049\'s haunting, irradiated Las Vegas.\n\nCD Projekt is great at teeing up a story that seems like it\'d be derivative or Spike TV-edgy, then absolutely curving you with unexpected depth and nuance, and that\'s no different here. President Myers comes off as a down to earth, \"one of the guys\" former soldier, like Harrison Ford from Air Force One, but there\'s a serpentlike ambition to her that comes out as the story goes on.\n\nIdris Elba is a real treat as Solomon Reed, a reluctant killer roused from deep cover to \"serve his country\" even though he hates Myers\' guts and was burned by his own agency years ago. They\'ve both got priors with Songbird, a brittle, emotionally compromised hacker with the strange ability to jack into your Keeanu Reeves-inhabited brain relic who also claims to have a cure for that bad boy brain rot. Reeves\' Johnny Silverhand is back for the ride too, and while he seems to be a bit of an acquired taste (former PCG editor James Davenport dubbed him \"John Prick\"), he makes for a great asshole Greek chorus in Phantom Liberty.\n\nCD Projekt makes a case here for more cinematic, bounded RPG design.\n\nThe main players in Phantom Liberty all think they\'re doing the right thing and that they don\'t have any other options, all while expecting you to back them up, and that eventually shakes out into one of the toughest choices I\'ve had to make in an RPG: you have to betray someone, and both ending paths feature their own triumphs and gut punches.\n\nThe path I chose was way more gut punches than triumphs, so I think I picked the \"bad\" ending. From chatting with my coworkers, though, the other option sounds at least bittersweet, and my RPG perfectionist drive to get the best ending possible is conflicting with just how good that bad ending was. The Darkest Timeline had me feeling like my stomach had a lead weight in it from the point of no return to credits rolling, and by the end, the bastards got away with everything. Forget it V, it\'s Dogtown.\n\nPhantom Liberty\'s main quests are a series of real dingers⁠—I was wondering how it would stack up post-Baldur\'s Gate 3, but CD Projekt makes a case here for more cinematic, bounded RPG design. Set pieces like that roulette table or the tense lead-up to the point of no return just popped for me. CD Projekt really is in the same league as Naughty Dog or Sony Santa Monica when it comes to delivering draw-dropping moments, but sets itself apart with the RPG choice, consequence, and interactivity I crave.\n\nGig economy\nI always enjoyed Cyberpunk\'s smaller side quests or \"gigs,\" too. Many are simple but enjoyable \"go here and kill everyone as fits your playstyle\" deals, but some of them felt more like full-on side stories with voice acting, a twist, and maybe even a gameplay curveball.\n\nPhantom Liberty\'s gig additions firmly fall into the latter camp, and I loved each one. A rescue operation for an underworld doctor gets complicated by his history of unsavory practices in one gig, while another sees you infiltrating the youth sports academy of the future, specializing in cybernetically enhanced 12-year-olds.\n\nMy favorite tasked me with helping out a pair of hapless chucklefuck detectives caught with their proverbial pants down in Dogtown and panicking for their lives. I felt like Harvey Keitel swooping in to save the day as the Wolf in Pulp Fiction, and the entire thing had this slapstick absurdity from beginning to end that I adored.\n\nDoggone it\nIt makes sense that Dogtown\'s physically siloed off from the rest of Night City, but I found myself wishing it was either better-integrated into the main game, or even more of a hostile, alien, alternate zone. The \"save the President\" plot actually resolves itself pretty quickly in favor of a deeper conspiracy, and you\'re subsequently free to come and go between Dogtown and Pacifica as you please, but the DLC really doesn\'t have you doing much in Night City proper aside from running quick errands like delivering procedurally spawned cars for its new, literal grand theft auto minigame.\n\nNight City just isn\'t tactile or inviting the way a good immersive sim or even the Elder Scrolls games manage to be.\n\nCyberpunk\'s base game has a stellar cast, and while this is a separate story, it feels weird to have the game\'s effective send-off have such little interplay with characters like Judy, Rogue, Kerry, or even Takemura. The lack of involvement for the game\'s four romanceable characters felt particularly odd to me. I had the chance to tell my base game beau that I was on a crazy new job for the Cyberpunk Intelligence Agency, but it basically felt like I was telling her \"I\'m gonna be in the expansion pack for a while babe, don\'t wait up.\"\n\nWhile Dogtown has a really cool, distinct look from the rest of Night City, it\'s still rocking the same basic design, and I found that a little disappointing. With the promise of a denser, smaller sandbox to play around in, I was hoping CD Projekt might flex its muscles making something closer to a Deus Ex hub. \n\nNow that 2.0 has fixed Cyberpunk\'s loot and progression woes, its biggest remaining issue to my eye is that there\'s no real call to explore or poke around its world outside explicit mission objectives. Night City just isn\'t tactile or inviting the way a good immersive sim or even the Elder Scrolls games manage to be⁠—no breaking into people\'s apartments and reading their diaries, you can only snoop in gig/mission-sanctioned areas. I think Dogtown\'s smaller, more manageable canvas could have been an opportunity to create something like that within Cyberpunk 2077. The visual feast of Night City has always clashed with how uninteractive its world is.\n\nStill, I\'m extremely pleased with Phantom Liberty⁠—CD Projekt can hang with the big dogs when it comes to cinematic storytelling, with a quality of writing and world building that I prefer to the likes of Sony\'s vaunted first party lineup. I\'ve been eager to see what CD Projekt would do with a Cyberpunk 2077 expansion ever since first beating the game at the end of 2020, and Phantom Liberty is a splendid sendoff for the world CD Projekt\'s been working on for the better part of the last 10 years.\n\n','2023-12-28 11:42:45.476000','Latest',_binary '',90,1,'2024-01-15 14:26:31.913000','2024-03-20 06:49:57.530000',3,7,37,NULL,'STEAM',1200,_binary '\0',NULL,'{\"Overall\":[\"improved mechanics\",\"engaging story\",\"critics praise\",\"2.0 update\",\"memorable quests\"],\"Accessibility\":[\"expansion pack\",\"little interplay\",\"base game characters\"],\"Sound\":[],\"Graphics & Art Design\":[\"cool look\",\"Night City design\",\"high-society shindig\",\"long dialogue puzzle\"],\"Suggestion\":[\"memorable quests\",\"CD Projekt choice-consequence\"],\"Gameplay\":[\"cinematic design\",\"set pieces\",\"gear deluge\",\"perks system\",\"soiree mission\",\"roulette table\",\"tense dialogue\"],\"Narrative\":[\"cinematic and bounded\",\"tough choices\",\"multiple endings\",\"high-society shindig\",\"deeper conspiracy\"],\"Bug\":[\"Night City tactile\",\"immersive sim\",\"Elder Scrolls games\"],\"Price\":[],\"tokenUsageBreakdown\":{\"aspect_response_tokens\":4550,\"keywords_tokens\":325,\"total_tokens\":5850,\"spam_tokens\":650},\"isSpam\":false,\"Performance\":[]}','Phantom Liberty, an expansion pack for Cyberpunk 2077','{\"-1\":[\"Repetitive but enjoyable experience with limited replay value.\",\"0.4392862617969513\"]}',_binary '\0',NULL,NULL),(91,'Pretty good demo showcase of the gamefeatures!','2023-12-30 14:55:58.909000','Latest',_binary '',80,1,'2024-01-15 14:26:32.101000','2024-01-15 14:26:32.102000',2,24,6,NULL,NULL,400,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(92,'This game is fine','2023-12-30 17:50:32.605000','Latest',_binary '',78,1,'2024-01-15 14:26:32.866000','2024-01-15 14:26:32.867000',2,8,32,NULL,'STEAM',912,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(93,'Stunning visual with amazing characters, making this one of the most immersive DLC ever created','2023-12-30 17:58:01.470000','Latest',_binary '',95,1,'2024-03-20 09:35:13.078000','2024-03-20 09:35:18.616000',6,8,15,NULL,'STEAM',2400,_binary '\0','2024-03-20 09:35:11.786000','{\"isSpam\":true}',NULL,'{\"0\":[\"Fun Space Exploration\",\"0.5157046318054199\"]}',_binary '',1,456),(94,'LET HUNT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!','2024-01-25 04:17:49.478000','Latest',_binary '',100,1,'2024-01-25 04:17:53.539000','2024-01-25 04:17:53.544000',1,4,40,NULL,'PS4',234,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(95,'This game features some of the best character building and story ever and really showcases the power of ray-tracing and path-tracing technologies.','2024-01-28 02:12:38.409000','Latest',_binary '',95,1,'2024-01-28 02:12:40.937000','2024-01-28 02:12:40.939000',1,7,29,NULL,'STEAM',1200,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(97,'After 11 years, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been, somewhat unceremoniously, shut down in favour of the newer, shinier Counter-Strike: 2. Whether you like it or not, Valve wants you playing CS2. For those who don\'t take their CS all too seriously, CS2 won\'t seem like much of a change from CS:GO, besides some grenade changes, more detailed maps, and a disappointing lack of fan favourite game modes. And for those who train their aim on the reg and line up their smoke grenades, CS2 might look the part but lacks the precision of CS:GO\'s movement and gunplay.\n\nStill, CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike tick and even if the foundation seems a little sparse and a touch shaky right now, I\'m confident Valve have an FPS that\'ll supersede CS:GO in time.\n\nFor your average Counter-Strike-enjoyer, CS2 will seem more like a large CS:GO patch than a sequel eleven years in the making. Sure CS2 is powered by Valve\'s newer Source 2 engine, with a slew of smaller tweaks to menus and bigger tweaks to the way grenades work. Ultimately, though, it\'s still terrorists versus counter terrorists where budgets wax and wane depending on how many heads players have dinked in their crosshairs. Hop into a game of CS2 and it\'ll feel very, very similar to CS:GO. It\'s to be expected right? CS2 was always going to elevate a winning formula and not like, introduce wall running and a perk system.\n\nTransitioning from CS:GO to CS2 is easy peasy, as all of your settings and binds port over, alongside all your cosmetics. As a returning player, I had no problem hopping into CS2 and finding my feet quickly, which deserves a big thumbs up. Unfortunately for newcomers, the game\'s still poor at guiding you towards useful things, like tweaking your aim sensitivity or adjusting your crosshair or even what any of the modes actually entail. Guides or an experienced mate are likely necessities if you\'re feeling a bit overwhelmed, so CS still has some growing to do on the tutorial front.\n\nI\'d say your mileage may vary if you\'re playing Casual matches, as they\'re still a chaotic mass of bodies and grenades that offset the intricacies of bomb defusal, but hop into Deathmatch, Competitive or the new Premier mode and CS2 captures what makes Counter-Strike so damn crispy. As much as guns have personality and it\'s satisfying when you land your shots, CS is about question and answer, both in response to your teammates\' dots as they scurry about the map, as well as the sudden cracks of gunfire that break long periods of silence. Are you covering your allies\' blind spot? Is it time to rush B no stop? Yes and absolutely 1000%, yes.\n\nAnd if we examine the small changes more closely, they do play a more significant role in making match admin a bit easier. The flexibility of the new inventory means you\'re able to curate your weapons pool with a drag and drop, so you can finally have both CT assault rifles available in the buy menu if you\'d like (I am giddy). And the buy menu\'s been updated, so as your teammates purchase guns in-between rounds, little dots underneath each weapon\'s portrait help you see everyone\'s loadout at a glance. There\'s even a handy refund button to undo those slip-ups or ease last minute hits to the bank account.\n\nA web where players pick and ban maps in the Premier mode of CS2.\nThere\'s a new Premier game mode that\'s distinct from Competitive in a way that\'s not explained by any tooltips anywhere. Essentially, Competitive is the equivalent of ranked matches where you get to choose the maps you\'d like to play before you queue up. Premier has a whole map pick and ban phase, as well as a global/regional ranking with a points system dependent on how good you are.\nIt\'s on the surface where the game\'s most obvious change lies. Step into any map and it\'ll appear brighter and more colourful, with dark corners abolished in favour of visibility. Step into Mirage\'s palace and there\'s a proper sheen to the marble floor, the monster graffiti in Overpass now wraps around the tunnel with a mighty splash, and I\'d spend my Steam Points on a long weekend at Inferno\'s apartments because they\'re gorgeous now (noise might be an issue, but we compromise). Gone are the days of walls with the texture of hummus and I\'m here for it.\n\nOn the slightly-less-obvious-until-you-sling-one-across-a-map scale, grenades are more reactive to their surroundings. In CS:GO, smoke grenades would generate a puff of static fog that wouldn\'t budge until it disappeared. But in CS2, fog will curve around an arch and spill outwards, or wedge itself into a narrow gap and shoot upwards like it\'s been pinched by the stone. What\'s neat is how explosions from regular grenades will dissipate smoke for a second, exposing any poor bastards hiding away inside. And if you shoot through the edges of a cloud, it\'ll bobble around your bullets and potentially expose enemies, too.\n\nGenerally, I think the smoke grenade tweaks affect both your regular and serious players equally, as they\'re substantial enough to alter their most basic usage as quickly chucked sight blockers or entirely change how top players use them. I\'m by no means a serious player and even I\'ve found the new smokes awaken options that hadn\'t previously existed. Rather than waiting around tentatively for them to vanish or being surprised when someone erupts from the darkness, it finally feels like you\'re able to manipulate smokes inline with the rest of CS\'s sandbox.\n\nOverall match length has been reduced from a race to 16, to 13. Or in other terms, the maximum number of rounds has been reduced from 30 to 24 overall per match. I\'ve not found it an issue, and if anything, makes each and every round feel a little more meaningful.\nDespite some of these positive strides in maps and grenades, there\'s also a lot of goodness from CS:GO that hasn\'t found its way into CS2\'s launch. There\'s no Mac support. No Arms Race or War Games. No way in the console to go left-handed. Fan favourite maps like Cache and Train are absent. All of these will undoubtedly come with time, but it\'s frustrating that we can\'t go back to CS:GO and enjoy them because Valve snapped it out of existence. I don\'t blame players for thinking CS2 has \"cut the game in half\", as it sort of seems that way.\n\nThere\'s also an argument to be made about how some of the maps like Inferno and Italy have been \"overhauled\" and what overhauled means for most people. For folks like me, most of the changes are about as perceptible as spotting a lobster with pink eye. Most of these tweaks involve shifting a ledge a few inches to the right, which serves the side of the community for whom minutiae matter. Again an example of how CS2\'s updates will seem more substantial to some and barely present for others.\n\nA player in Counter-Strike 2 inspects their knife in front of a wall with colourful graffiti on it.\n\nHaving tuned into pro-players and their streams, it seems like there\'s a lot of talk about CS2 feeling off compared to CS:GO. Movement isn\'t quite as smooth and spraying with your weapon doesn\'t feel as accurate. The new servers with their 64 tick/sub-tick thing just doesn\'t cut it, apparently (I have zero idea what sub-tick means). For long-time fans and serious CS-heads, it seems like CS2 has some catching up to do. And as a sort of lapsed player who used to take it quite seriously but doesn\'t anymore, I agree that the sensation of accuracy in holding down the trigger feels a bit… off in CS2? I\'ve also been sniped around a corner a few times, which didn\'t happen in CS:GO, and might be something to do with those server ticks? But hey, I\'m finding my matches of CS2 just as thrilling as before! And I\'m sure most players will, too.\n\nIt wouldn\'t be CS - or any videogame, I suppose - without rounding off a game and being hit by cosmetic rewards and the like. If you bought CS:GO back in the day, you\'ll get what\'s called \"Prime Status\" free of charge in CS2, otherwise it will cost you £15. Those with Prime Status unlock the competitive and premier modes, plus queues with other Prime members. In theory, it\'s Valve\'s way of saying that you\'re more likely to play against people who don\'t take their FPS video games for granted. Eh, I\'ve still been matched up with both lovely people and horrible folks I\'ve reported almost instantly, so I doubt it makes much of a difference. Either way, what Prime also enables is the Weekly Care Package, so if you earn enough EXP and level up, you\'ll get to choose two cosmetic rewards to add to your collection. Cool, I guess.\n\nValve\'s still at it with loot crates you\'ve got to pay to open and the dodgy marketplaces that orbit it. But I wouldn\'t say it\'s super in your face, as you can choose to not engage with it if you\'d like. I basically do not care for any skins or crates or anything and the game doesn\'t hit me with pop-ups or punish me for tuning out. I\'m not saying I like the whole gambling thing and I wish it didn\'t exist, but you\'re at least free to disengage.\n\nEven so, if I\'m being perfectly honest, I think my CS days are behind me. It\'s an FPS that requires a lot from you, and those after a shooter you can sort of switch your mind off to should look elsewhere. But if you\'re a newcomer, lapsed player, or veteran, I think CS2 offers up thrilling matches that can twist and turn after a smart play or a remarkable shot. Many will find it\'s rather close to CS:GO with neat upgrades to grenades and extra pop to maps, while another portion of the community might just want CS:GO back. Right now CS2 is a great iterative update to a tried and true formula... that\'s missing an awful lot of fan favourite stuff. Give it time, though, and I think it\'s onto something pretty special.','2024-02-09 06:52:39.389000','Latest',_binary '\0',60,-1,'2024-02-09 06:52:41.601000','2024-03-20 15:04:35.492000',13,1,12,NULL,'STEAM',2000,_binary '\0',NULL,'{\"Overall\":[\"positive reception\",\"map pick and ban phase\",\"ranking system\",\"brighter maps\",\"similar to CS:GO\",\"improved grenades\",\"gunfire sounds\",\"flexible inventory for match administration\"],\"sentiment\":{\"Suggestion\":\"Positive\",\"Overall\":\"Positive\",\"Accessibility\":\"Positive\",\"Gameplay\":\"Positive\",\"Narrative\":\"NA\",\"Bug\":\"NA\",\"Price\":\"Positive\",\"Sound\":\"Positive\",\"Performance\":\"Positive\",\"Graphics & Art Design\":\"Positive\"},\"Accessibility\":[\"improved visibility\",\"brighter maps\",\"eliminating dark corners\",\"newcomer guidance\",\"easy transition\"],\"Sound\":[\"immersive sound\",\"satisfying gunfire\",\"sudden cracks\"],\"Graphics & Art Design\":[\"brighter graphics\",\"colorful\",\"detailed maps\",\"increased visibility\",\"slight alterations\"],\"Suggestion\":[\"no penalty for cosmetic microtransactions\",\"optional cosmetic features\"],\"Gameplay\":[\"map pick\",\"ban phase\",\"global ranking\",\"solid movement\",\"gunplay\",\"new inventory\",\"easy admin\",\"upgrades\",\"changes\",\"newcomers\",\"lapsed players\",\"veterans\"],\"Narrative\":[\"minimal narrative\",\"gameplay focus\"],\"Bug\":[\"NA\"],\"Price\":[\"cosmetic rewards\",\"loot crates\",\"play or purchase\",\"Prime Status\",\"Valve\'s loot crate system\"],\"isSpam\":false,\"Performance\":[\"overhauled maps\",\"minor changes\",\"brighter\",\"colorful\",\"flexible inventory\"]}','The context describes the characteristics of a game, CS2, with positive reception.

Space ship, check.  Craft stuff, check.  Read stuff, check.  Make buildings, check. Romances...oooo…check.  Loot stuff, stolen stuff, vendors, guns, more guns, pew pew, zap zap.  Lots of things for The Dragonborn, er Dusty to do.

I also think they realized the community was already at ‘get a rope’ and now are patching to a new paradigm.\nThe stats are pretty telling…less than 75% of players even got the achievement for 5th level as of this writing.  So, they either bailed in the first part of the game (about the time they came back with the loot they couldn’t sell) and decided that the few dozen lines of dialog with their new companion offered wasn’t worth a second date, or they used the console to try and fix the mess and voided Achievement tracking.  My second trip back, I dumped it on the ground at the landing site and paid myself and moved on.  I loot a couple dozen enemies and now I have more wealth than even the Galaxies’ largest Trade Authority can handle?  Huge waste of my time.

At least let me scrap the gear and use the components to make better gear and level skills.\n\nIn the end, it’s basically a 3d procedurally generated hiking simulator with a one-dimensional plot.

The main story really has no branching paths that would warrant many playthroughs and the game knows this. It\'s why you can skip the main quest in certain situations, the side quests varied from very good to very bad. As much as I enjoyed the Crimson Fleet and thought it was one of the best quests ever made, it really lacks in replayability I mean it\'s a dichotomy. On the otherhand I could hardly bring myself to finishing the Ryujin quest, as it was just too much radiant quests where I spent more time running than actually role playing my character or shooting people. I mean the UC and Freestar Collective in the game, but why? They don\'t have any impact on the actual story, you can\'t really roleplay for very long for either faction, you have nothing to do from top to bottom, it\'s one of the few times I would have preferred a Faction war. Because at the moment, all you have to do in the game really is the main quest which is linear, four faction quests, and a spattering of side quests which vary from fun to boring beyond belief. I know they can improve the game, they can flesh out the world and I hope that when I return in a year the game will be vastly improved much like Cyberpunk, I look forwards to the DLC. I really enjoyed building my ships, and as a guy who has at least 40 hours in Fallout 4 just building settlements I cannot say that the settlement building in this game was fun at all, it was tedious and boring. Overall all I want is a reason to replay the game, give me anything that would warrant me playing this game as much as I played FO3, NV, and FO4 because at the moment there is nothing. I hate to say it, Betehsda is my favorite games studio, Todd Howard will always be the God but whoever wrote this knew about the replayability factor from the begining and despite that fact they made no effort to write a nonlinear story with multiple paths. I mean in a game where the universe will reset no matter what you do, there are at least hundreds of essential NPC\'s, why?

Unfortunately it\'s still too new so there arent any yet.\nBut I believe data miners have already found unused code that hints towards expansions, which honestly makes me pretty excited.\nI\'m very picky with games but with the right gameplay pretty easy to please. I knew going in it was randomly generated to some extent, I don\'t know how other people thought this meant those planets would have more personality than they could. They\'re random, from a pool of assets and scenarios, it\'s going to be limited if you keep playing and go NG+. \n\nWhat makes the game good is the freedom. Sure, something can repeat, but isn\'t the point of playing an RPG to role play? Pretending you are your character, who has NG+ed themselves into a similar or same scenario or environment, the fun can come from you. The game doesn\'t actually have to do it all for you, isn\'t that how minecraft is so popular? It doesnt have fancy graphics, the biomes are rando gen, but people play pretend and then it\'s fun. But also, it has mods too.\nIf you actually explore, you\'ll find some pretty cool creatures, and some are farm-able. I think some of these loops could be expanded further, but as they are now isn\'t bad, just \"limited\". That seems to be the main gripe people have, that loops are limited, exploration is \"shallow\", etc. but it is also a game that is doing many things at once, so I expected that. Like I said, expansions and/or mods could really build off of what there is. And there is actually a lot. Have I had random encounters happen more than once? Yes, but I also put 80 hours in and hit NG+, so it was only a matter of time.\n\nSo long story short, mods will help, there is a possibility of expansions that will add to or even address content people find shallow now, but personally I think it\'s fun. There are some bugs, but I haven\'t hit anything substantial that doesnt have a workaround or fix. Just enable auto save and keep your saves organized and it\'s not a problem. There\'s no other game out where you can customize your character and ship to this extent, if it were multiplayer it would be the game of the decade. \n\nMy only actual complaints are swinging my sword is slow, and ships could use a bit more customization on the inside, if there\'s a mod to address either or both eventually then that would be good. \n','2024-02-23 16:14:34.339000','121',_binary '',62,1,'2024-02-24 04:47:10.539000','2024-02-24 04:47:10.540000',1,8,43,NULL,'STEAM',5285,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(224,'meh','2024-02-23 16:14:34.660000','122',_binary '\0',48,-1,'2024-02-24 04:47:10.514000','2024-02-24 04:47:10.515000',1,8,42,NULL,'STEAM',7410,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(225,'471 hours of game play, largely spent on building ships. *tiny spoilers ahead* The attention to detail is stunning, and the graphics are the best of any Bethesda game thus far, but the customization of Ships and Settlements is what kept me more busy than the admittedly lackluster quest lines that I haven\'t bothered to explore the full breadth of. It does fit the usual formula - reusable assets and radiant/fetch quests, interesting random encounters, 3 hours of game play lost from a bug at the end of one mission after forgetting to save often enough, companions getting lost or into precarious positions, running full steam into walls, and 4ish factions to play through. \n\nThe problem is: it is starting to feel repetitive. The assets reused in this game are far more than any other Bethesda game to date, possibly combined. The majority of the companions are all from one place, and none of them really offer the affinity side-quests that were granted from other games like FO4 or Skyrim. Speech and wait your way into highest affinity and it achieves, no special perks. So to me, who does not care for in-game romances, companions are generally a waste of time and space. I guess the up front boosts to some perks and skills can be useful but the game generally isn\'t difficult or diverse enough that I have to tactically decide which companion I need. The difficulty is laughable at best, like ragdolling spacers on a low grav planet, or my ship destroying an enemy ship before I can even see what it looks like because it appeared on a flank I can\'t see. The visual details are pretty cool, but overly repeated and reused. The powers are completely useless, the spacesuits don\'t offer the type of combat or environmental boosts that would feel appropriate. What this game is, is a host of new assets for the mod community to shake up and put to better use. Bethesda gave us the template and the assets for the mod community to fix what is otherwise a relatively lackluster user experience. And that\'s coming from me, who actually really likes this game. The pop culture references are cool, the quests are on par with Bethesda standards, and the game finally lets you just restart and keep the same character by going through NG+, but it feels, empty. More empty than the game space itself.\n\nMy conclusion, \nJust get the devs to unlock mod support so the community can fix this game rightly, it has so much potential, but currently it\'s a gold gilding over an uncompleted game. My list of demands/suggestions\n\n-Everything to do with flying ships. \nA loading screen, animation, static spot on the ground, or in low orbit are generally your only options. Why can\'t we land (or even crash!) the thing, or fly from a planet surface to its moon, or planet to planet. or just randomly into the infinite depths of open space to see what junk is floating around out there.\n\n-Some form of terrestrial transportation.\nIt could be the space ship itself, or some kind of smaller flying pod, or even a wheeled ground vehicle would make the everlong sprint between locations much more tolerable. the vastness of the planets is fine, and the open desolation is to be somewhat expected, but 1.6 gravity and locations 800M away just aren\'t worth even trying to get to.\n\n-More companions coming from different places\nCorrect me if I\'m wrong, but it seems like the majority of companions come from Constellation, so apparently they have really good hybrid work policies or something. I haven\'t found companions anywhere else, only crew members or settlement members. and the companion system was already complained about above\n\n-More cities\nYou mean to tell me that all of humanity is spread across like, 8 settlements? come on.\n\n-More volatility on planetary surfaces\nSpace is terrifying, but Starfield doesn\'t really make it feel like it is. the planets are all pretty tame save for the SUPER rare sandstorm. where are the active volcanoes, geysers, lava floes, boiling pools of molten minerals, earthquakes, snap freezes, firestorms, acid rain, solar flares, make me think twice before just landing on any speck of rock I want to\n\n-Aliens.\nObviously there\'s flora and fauna, but I think the addition of some other intelligent life or hominid would be a good one. Even if they were primitive and inherently hostile, or exceedingly advanced like the little green men of Bethesda past. A space-sim missing out on this is borderline sad. Fallout Universe already gave us Synthetic Humans and Zetans, Elder scrolls gave us Daedric and magical beings (Underfykde Matron, anyone?). Having just humans and space livestock is a missed opportunity\n\n-Builders enhancements\nSnap-to-fit furniture for settlements, or more customizeable settlement spaces would be nice. and I would love to be able to choose where the INTERIOR doors and hatches land on my ship.\n\n-Flashlight customization\nIt\'s so bad, that I just turned up the game brightness. FO4 had flashlight improvement options...\n\n-Bigger ships. \nLike, settlement big. big enough to dock another A,B,C class ship or two but still be able to move the whole thing around the galaxy (Mothership and lander perhaps?) I don\'t care to land the thing on anything more than some super specialized landing pad exclusive to only one or two locations in the whole game, but I see Legendary M-Class ships, and I want something bigger!\n\n-Noted above, Spacesuit characteristics\nFor example, the mining suits increasing oxygen and lift capacity, Bounty Hunter suit should resist combat damage, Ground Crew suit lets you repair your own ship damages, faction related suits should cause people to react as if you\'re a part of that faction. how about an underwater spacesuit to explore those very few oceans?\n\nI still play it regularly, but it needs some love.

Don\'t get me wrong, there\'s much to explore, but there\'s very little to find. In making this game, Bethesda seemingly forgot to add the things that made their games great, worlds with things to find hidden away off the beaten path, memorable stories that will hook you just waiting to be discovered, a feeling of adventure. However, Starfield doesn\'t have these things, instead, it simply exists as little more than a tech demo, it\'s great stories, interesting characters, and adventure, seemingly little more than an afterthought, floating in a vast universe with nothing that feels good to do.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, I have 173 hours in the game, and I can\'t say I didn\'t have at least some fun along the way, but I also can\'t say that in it\'s current state that Starfield was worth it. I don\'t blame the absolutely wonderful dev team for Starfields issues, that blame lays solely on it\'s management, the people who decided that Starfield, a game that lacks the heart soul of Bethesda\'s previous titles, should have been released.\n\nFor those players who have found enjoyment in Starfield; I truly hope you can continue to do so, but for me personally, Starfield is no longer worth the space it takes up on my PC.\n\nFor those wondering if they should buy Starfield; I\'d wait a while, let this one bake for a bit, and perhaps someday, it too may be great.','2024-02-23 16:14:50.408000','176',_binary '\0',43,-1,'2024-02-24 04:47:12.228000','2024-02-24 04:47:12.229000',1,8,44,NULL,'STEAM',10381,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(279,'Personally, I really love this game!

It feels wholly disconnected. The gameplay loop is a drag, and needs a complete overhaul in order to be fun. The worst part is, all throughout the game there is a reference to the \"Colony War\" which is described as a way more exciting and interesting time to be in than the one the player is currently in. \n\nOh, and the end game NG+ mechanic is very poorly executed. With the way the game works, there are no consequences for story mode decisions, so there is no point to NG+ besides seeing alternate dialogue options, or to see what \"original universe\" you get put into. The only difference among these universes is changes among the constellation members, constellation being your main faction which you are required to work with to make progress in the main story.\n\nSave yourself the trouble and stay far far away, perhaps in another galaxy.

My recommendation, to those contemplating a purchase of SF, is to take leap of faith and decide for yourself.\n\nRD','2024-02-23 16:14:56.049000','196',_binary '',85,1,'2024-02-24 04:47:12.862000','2024-02-24 04:47:12.863000',1,8,44,NULL,'STEAM',851,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(299,'If you enjoy exploration and moltimodal building and battling across a vast expanse of environments you will enjoy this game','2024-02-23 16:14:56.286000','197',_binary '',63,1,'2024-02-24 04:47:12.889000','2024-02-24 04:47:12.890000',1,8,44,NULL,'STEAM',42675,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(300,'     A very good challenging game,  With lot,s of things to do, for you to  achieve.','2024-02-23 16:14:56.538000','198',_binary '',62,1,'2024-02-24 04:47:12.919000','2024-02-24 04:47:12.921000',1,8,42,NULL,'STEAM',9657,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(301,'I honestly don\'t know how i got to 164 hours...Story line is 7/10 but game play becomes repetitive.

A lot of \"features\" ruin the immersion: Lack of voice lines for your character, cut scenes everytime you go into dialog, constant loading screens, the fact that you can hardly fly your ship, the required over use of fast travel to get anything done, just to name a few.

Flexibility to choose different paths (while not novel) is well executed. Customization and ship building are solid too, but this is less important to me personally. I did not encounter many bugs either so I will actually put that as a pro, it played pretty smoothly. I put in a fair amount of time, but mainly because I was excited for the game and gave it the old college try (tbh I spent a lot of time AFK so can probably subtract close to 6 hrs from my time on record rn of 36 hrs).\n\nCons: Lacks exploration and spontaneity of other open world games, game pace feels very slow (half the missions I played are just fast traveling to talk to someone which begins to feel like a chore considering the number of different actions & cut scenes needed to get from one place to the next), characters lack the liveliness that I would hope from a big budget game, space and moons and planets are very realistic meaning there is a lot of nothing, (maybe a light spoiler warning) flying around the temples endless times to touch the light things was drawn out and annoying after maybe the 3rd.\n\nIn the end the game just isn\'t fun. If it was a flavor in an ice cream shop it would be non-fat sugar-free vanilla frozen yogurt.

Would I regret spending $70 on that yogurt once I realized that no matter the window dressing it\'s just not good as ice cream (read; other games)?

We do so multiple times a week.\n\nWhen I first jumped into this game, I was amazed. So much to do and so much to explore! It felt great. Like I was on the cusp of some fantastic new adventure.\n\nBut it didn\'t last - you knew this was coming. From the outside and when you just dip your finger in, it certainly looks like there\'s a lot to Starfield, but you eventually realise that there really isn\'t. A mile wide and an inch deep encapsulates this game perfectly.\n\nThere are good things about Starfield, make no mistake. But nearly without fail, it\'s stunted by the bad things and prevented from actually being great. Let\'s look at an example: shipbuilding in this game is really fun. You can look at what so many players have managed to create. That\'s where it ends, though, because as with many other things here - THERE\'S NOTHING TO IT. Your ship is basically a glorified fast travel terminal. \n\nThere\'s also outpost building. It seems really cool, you know, going out there into the vast unknown and building your own little slice of home there. But, again, THERE\'S NOTHING TO IT. Once you build your first one just to see how cool it is, you quickly realise that there isn\'t really any more of a point to doing so.\n\nThat brings me nicely to exploration. Who the hell at Bethesda played this and thought \"hey, it will be fun!\" because it isn\'t. You can\'t land wherever you want on the planet as you can in, say, No Man\'s Sky. You have to point at where you want on the map, and then through a few loading screens, you finally arrive into your allotted fishbowl. I call it a fishbowl because that\'s precisely what it is, and it\'s not a particularly interesting one either. You slow jog around for a while to see the usual points of interest that are replicated on every other planet in the game, no matter its character, from supposedly civilised and settled ones, all the way to the ones which are supposed to be more \'undiscovered\'. No matter what, you\'ll find all the same things. It\'s especially puzzling when it comes to the temples in game - a temple that has supposedly been undiscovered for centuries by humans is only a few hundred metres away from a human settlement of some form. It simply makes no sense. Then after slow jogging around this fishbowl, you will be hit with an invisible wall. Oh, and did I mention that it has no land vehicles of any sort? What the hell is a space exploration game without a space buggy? I also don\'t think I need to mention that it\'s unacceptable to have so many loading screens from a game released in 2023.\n\nI can\'t begin to state how much of a better design decision it would have been for Starfield to have only a few planets that were handcrafted without invisible walls or random generation, or at least, that kept to a minimum. But they sold that away for the \"1,000 planets\" marketing gimmick. Beautiful handcrafted worlds are the bread and butter of Bethesda\'s games. It\'s why we love them and more importantly, why we put up with the bugs and the other misgivings. Without that, what does the game have? Nothing. And that\'s where we\'re at with Starfield.\n\nIn general, I feel that Bethesda may have just lost it. Other game companies have put out far superior titles with features that are better than in Starfield, or they\'re actually present in the first place.

As with the other Monster Hunter games, the story is only mildy interesting, but that\'s all it needs to be. The main focus is of course fighting the monsters and exploring the environments, and it is such a joy to do so. Originally I got this game at launch on Xbox as a birthday present and played through the whole thing (and then later half of the Iceborne DLC). Now that I play on PC and the game has had a recent resurgence of players, it was the perfect time to replay it and I\'m glad I did. It looks amazing, especially with the official high resolution texture pack (linked below). The game offers a lot of content and lots of different weapons to try out so if you see it on sale getting it is a no-brainer for me at least.\n\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/960781/Monster_Hunter_World__High_Resolution_Texture_Pack/','2024-02-25 23:08:32.000000','1',_binary '',82,1,'2024-02-26 07:23:15.233000','2024-02-26 07:23:15.234000',2,4,56,NULL,'STEAM',2577,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(345,'I\'m not sure how to even describe this game.\n\nI would say I\'m primarily a PoE player. The most hours I\'ve put into games in the last couple of years are PoE and recently BG3. \n\nI\'ve got maybe 2-300 hours in BG3 and probably around 900-1k hours in PoE. I consider PoE my favorite game.\n\nBut then I had the pleasure of finally playing MHW. I bought it back in 2018 and maybe got on for an hour only to turn it back off. Bought the Iceborne DLC like 2 years ago only to play another hour or so and turn it off. \n\nSomething just clicked this time... Pro Tip for all the new people: DONT PLAY WITH THE GUARDIAN OR DEFENDER GEARS\n\nI would say you definitely can play with them eventually even as early as pre iceborne in the high ranks or so.\n\nBut for a new player you would be neutering yourself essentially by picking up these gears at the very start. \n\nThis game is EXTREMELY methodical in its itemization and gearing system. If you like ARPGS like Last Epoch and PoE you will enjoy the gearing very early on if you just dont play with the defender and guardian gears they give you.\n\nWill it take longer and require you to actually think about your gear combos/synergies? Absolutely. But by the time you get to the end game you absolutely will have learned a thing or two about the build you\'re going for, your loadouts, the synergies that your weapon excels in.\n\nAnd funnily enough the absolute juggernaut of a statement that was conceived in the PoE community holds 100% true in MHW: \"The end game is where the game actually begins\" \n\nThe end game is where you will take on your toughest challenges and build the most ridiculous of gears.\n\nI just got into the end game and honestly this game has crept up into on of the greatest games I\'ve played. While it may not strike your eye at first (the same way it didn\'t with me initially) I highly suggest you try it.\n\nI\'ve played hundreds of games. The memories I\'ve created in this game I don\'t think Ill ever forget. The first time running into the big red dinosaur of the forest and the absolute fear it strikes in you as you try to run away. Up until the first fight with said dinosaur. \n\nThen there is this land in the game that I would imagine every fan of fantasy dreams about. The Elders Recess. This land which has floors of lava and geysers which burst lava out. Big dangerous dragons and large wyverns. All of them VS just you a mere mortal. \n\nA true David Vs Goliath tale. I genuinely dont know how to describe this feeling. \n\nThat feeling of just being a mere mortal standing in front of a roaring fire breathing dragon. Sword and Shield in hand (that conveniently turns into an axe hehe) and a powerful guard ability.\n\nYou really feel that OOMPH that heavy heavy feeling of completely stuffing a dragons fire breath with your meaty shield. \n\nYou really FEEL that moment when you nail a beast 5-10 times your size right in the face. Using your most powerful charged a tack to just rock a dragons sh*t Mike tyson style.\n\nAn absolute masterpiece of a game. \n\nThere are people that hate on it because \"its too clunky\" or \"its too slow\" or \"its not monster hunter 1 and I hate it because i am obsessed with my nostalgia\"\n\nJust dont listen to these people. Its slow because its as if your controlling a mortal human.

Game still holds up and PC is the best way to play it going forward, thanks to best available hardware and of course fan made mods (psst, some of them improve performance and let you skip cutscenes!)\n\nIf you\'re new to MH, you need to go in understanding the game will kick your butt over and over and part of the fun is the learning experience. Otherwise you will join the ranks of countless threads complaining the game is unfair. Sure it aint perfect, there are some wonky hitboxes occasionally and some monsters really enjoy true comboing you to death if you\'re unlucky (F off, Shara). If a weapon isnt working out for you, try a different one, it makes the game feel completely different depending what you pick. And as first stated theres tons of content here that, if you exhaust all of it, will be a couple years worth of consistent playtime.\n\nShould you buy or wait for Wilds? I\'d say buy, especially on sale. Theres quite an active community right now so co op is accessible though it might be a bit barren at low rank, most people wont join you till you hit high rank for SOS (except people farming the achievement for helping low rank players). Wilds will probably be World but more refined, and, HOPEFULLY, no god damn Clutch Claw, which to me is a zit on an otherwise amazing gameplay loop.\n\nDont buy this game if youre a story hound though, the acting is extremely stilted and the characters love prattling on about vaguely smart sounding gibberish, it\'s clear this was the mon hun teams first foray into longer cutscenes and actual characters, hopefully they dial back the cutscenes in Wilds and give the player more agency instead of making the Handler the main character.','2024-02-23 11:51:09.000000','1',_binary '',89,1,'2024-02-26 07:36:31.327000','2024-02-26 07:36:31.328000',2,4,176,NULL,'STEAM',6006,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(467,'i think ive killed so much wildlife Peta is gonna bomb my house','2024-02-23 08:36:20.000000','1',_binary '',58,1,'2024-02-26 07:36:31.921000','2024-02-26 07:36:31.921000',2,4,177,NULL,'STEAM',8023,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(468,'gud  gam','2024-02-23 08:21:44.000000','1',_binary '',85,1,'2024-02-26 07:36:33.802000','2024-02-26 07:36:33.803000',2,4,178,NULL,'STEAM',21996,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(469,'i play this game everytime i get frustrated in ranked tekken.\n\nthen get shitstomped by everything flying and get frustrated again\n\n\n10/10 recommend','2024-02-23 07:37:32.000000','1',_binary '',85,1,'2024-02-26 07:36:35.452000','2024-02-26 07:36:35.452000',2,4,179,NULL,'STEAM',2606,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(470,'Raging Brachydios goes ORA ORA ORA!','2024-02-23 07:05:58.000000','1',_binary '',63,1,'2024-02-26 07:36:36.725000','2024-02-26 07:36:36.725000',2,4,180,NULL,'STEAM',16172,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(471,'Great amazing game just need to put more time into it but definitely not spending crazy long hours into like some people cough cough.','2024-02-23 06:08:19.000000','1',_binary '',94,1,'2024-02-26 07:36:38.277000','2024-02-26 07:36:38.278000',2,4,181,NULL,'STEAM',152,_binary '\0',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(472,'Much better than RISE.

But I am here to provide input for potential purchasers who are like me.  I can see how others can really enjoy this game, but it is most definitely not for me.  This game is written with a view that is different from the games I normally play.  I could be wrong, but I attribute it to being designed and developed by people from a different culture.  And while different is OFTEN good in my experience, in this case I found the differences are keeping me from enjoying it.  I suspect I\'m just too old a dog to appreciate new tricks. As far as specifics (and some of these matter and others, well, are just personal disappointments):   I have never, in my 30+ year gaming experience had so much information presented to me to, ostensibly, help me, while at he same time feeling more lost than I ever have in a game.   The games continuous popups to explain were really appreciated when I first saw them.  But later, I realized, my eyes had glazed over and I was no longer reading them.  Basically, if you have to present that many popups to explain things, then your stuff\'s a wee bit too complicated imho.  Next, we tried to do multiplayer and have given up.  It\'s not that we couldn\'t make it happen, it\'s just too complicated to do!  All we wanted was to play together, and it is so friggin\' complicated that we\'ve now shelved the game.  Oh, and the complicated game play is way out of proportion to the complicated nature of the play.  In other words, I have really complicated games in my library, but the story and consequences merit that complexity.   Here, it feels like the game concept is simple, whereas the game mechanics and interface and hugely complicated.  In short, I don\'t care enough about the game to deal with all this complexity.  Or said another way, we though we were going to pop into a game where we\'d have some fun playing together, developing our characters and slaying some monsters.  But the complexity of the interface and understanding how the game works, just sapped us of any desire to play it.  If I wanted this much complexity in my life, I\'d play a strategy game (Stellaris) or a \'reallife\' shooter (Escape from Tarkov), or pick up a simulator (flight or racing).  I don\'t want or need this kind of complexity for slashing dinosaurs.  My daughter (and adult gamer) and I got two copies of this to play, and we were thinking we\'d maybe invite my wife to play if we had fun.  There is no way I would invite a non- or quasi- gamer to play this game.  It\'s way too complex for such a person.  The reward versus the investment of time to understand this game is just way out of whack for us.  Again, I see many people love this game.  I am not here to rain on their parade.  All I am saying is that this game was a major mismatch with me (60 yrs of age) and my adult daughter (25 yrs of age).  Now, to be fair, she seems to enjoy the game itself, but was completely washing her hands of the multiplayer aspect.  Way too complicated to figure out when you could and could not play with another and under what circumstances and only after you started your mission, but only after you watched this cutscene, blah blah blah blah.  complete insanity as far as we were concerned.  And i know there many MANY out there who will read this and go \"but it\'s simple, just do..\"  I am a software developer who has been coding UIs and playing games since the late 1980s.  I was there for DOOMs launch.  I have played complicated games.  I networked back when we\'d have net-meets and had to create LANs to get multiplayer.  I have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours in Falcon 4.0, one of the most complicated sims ever released.  I know complicated.  But since the 2000s we have, thankfully, existed in world where developers have increasingly created UI-friendly games (I mean, when was the last time you have even seen a manual for game?)   This game REQUIRES a manual.  They didn\'t create one in favor of putting in all this help inline, but the fact that it is so needed is only proof that the UI is overly complicated.\n\nSo, as you contemplate acquiring this game, you may just never know.  Will it click with you?  Will the complicated UI be easily understandable?  No way to know really.  If you can, play a friend\'s copy, or see if you can find a demo.

Look out to resources and food to gather. Capture, obtain, or kill pals - cute monsters spread all over around the map - to get resources, gain exp and level up. As you do so, get access to better items and structures that can be built.\n\nPlenty of functional and decorative options to spruce up your base up. Rather large structures can be built, though foundation building can be restrictive in rough and uneven terrain.\n\nI like how pals still drop their items and exp even if you opt to catch them, instead of killing them.\n\nCaptured or obtained pals can be used either as partners that can be used in battles, riding, etc., or as slave workers in your base. Or sacriced to improve the stats of another pal, so there is benefit on having dozens of the same one.\n\nMultiplayer access is optional and can also be enabled and disabled at any time. That being said, there is no difficulty scaling, so playing with others may make defeating and/or capturing high level unique pals or bosses, and resources gathering, easier.\n\nPal AI behaviors do have some issues. For one, pals assigned to work at bases easily get stuck or otherwise refuse to work. Pal assignment to specific tasks is rather tedious, and even if done, pals may not follow through for long. Pals may also easily get hungry, even with abundant and good quality food available.\n\nCUSTOMIZATION:\nI love how the game allows for easy customization of many of the game rules, such as catch rate, hunger rate, player and pal dealt and received damage, death penalties, etc. that can be freely modified at anytime throughout the map progression. This can make for a very easy and relaxing game - or the complete opposite.\n\nUnfortunately no Steam Workshop so if one is interested in modding and further game customization. they have to be obtained and manually installed through third party places like Nexus.\n\nWORLD\nThe map is huge but is static and not randomly generated. Teleport statues make fast travel between very distant locations easy, but given the size of the map travel can still feel slow at times, especially in some of the more advanced islands where such statues are located further apart.\n\nThere are Alpha and unique/\"legendary\" pals whose locations are clearly indicated in the player map, a nice feature IMO.\n\nLots of empty areas in the map do exist - i.e. open water - and where additional content might be placed in future updates, but at the moment do not contribute to the game, other than make thee player waste time needlesly exploring the map.\n\nVISUALS\nSimply stunning to look at. Plays amazingly in ultrawidescreen 5120x1440. I love the huge rendering distances. Pals do look adorable. I would say something to improve in this area are better costume/armor variety/customization.\n\nSTORY/PLOT\nVery sparse and needs work. The character controlled are explorers that somehow all end up in the island after a shipwreck. There is some lore spread out throughout the region.\n\nThere are also human factions supposedly trying to exploit the place, and their bosses that can be killed off, but doing so or not adds nothing of value to the story or even to the player, other than exp and achievements, at the moment.\n\nMUSIC/SOUND\nUnderwhelming and often absent. Some music plays off during pal and boss battles, but otherwise the game is eerily silent.\n\nSUMMARY:\nGreat combination of Pokemon gotta catch them all and survival base games like ARK or Don\'t Starve Together, but significantly cuter. It has some issues at the moment but it is in early access and was not released long ago, so I am sure improvements will come in time.

These fights with the creatures feel frantic at points; the combat itself plays like a first-person shooter where I shoot monsters and evade their attacks by rolling around like I would in a Soulslike game. After catching creatures like, say, a giant dinosaur that looks like a rubber toy, I realize my character needs to eat, just as I would in Minecraft. Lucky for me, the food I scavenged up and cooked at my base hasn’t expired yet. I scarf it down and I’m good to go, so I jog over a stretch of a wooded forest to arrive at a new waypoint of the sprawling natural world — just like I would in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\nFor some people, Palworld might be a little too much, and too overwhelming since it brings together elements from so many different games and genres. The fact that the game even functions on a basic level feels like something of a marvel — a sentiment that’s shared by the CEO of Pocketpair, the Japanese indie studio that created Palworld, who described the making of Palworld as a “miracle.” But as a person whose gaming taste has been largely shaped by series like Pokémon, Fortnite, The Legend of Zelda, and Minecraft, the awkward hodgepodge of Palworld feels like it’s tailor-made for me.\n\nPalworld starts with a tutorial that functions like an extended to-do list guiding players up to the first boss fight. Slowly but surely I have worked my way up from picking objects up off the ground to crafting items and harvesting materials, then automating several resource collection processes by continually upgrading my bases and putting my Pokémon-like Pal creatures to work. As I play, I popcorn between managing my base and catching Pals while I explore the game’s overworld.\n\nAlthough forcing my Pals to work forms an unavoidable part of the game, the way I catch and play alongside the Pals in the game doesn’t feel all that dark or transgressive — at least, not in the way the game’s ads insinuated. Sure, I can fire the adorable penguin-like Pal, Pengullet, from a rocket launcher and it will explode like a bomb, but the game’s cartoony nature tends to skew more toward absurdity than brutality. Palworld isn’t graphic and it doesn’t seem to encourage the mistreatment of Pals all that much, since I need them to work. If anything, I found the way that its systems explicitly highlight the inherently exploitative relationship between the creatures and the player-character to be refreshing, even if the game’s writing doesn’t offer any particular commentary on that relationship.\n\nI released a Relaxaurus, the big dumb rubber dino I caught earlier, onto my base for the first time and just hollered when I saw it completely dwarf all the Pals and blankly stare at them with a look that screamed, “I have exactly two brain cells and I am using both of them to water your damn berries.” Then there’s Depresso, a sullen cat who requires constant chemical motivation, provided by pressing F to give it a “caffeine inoculation.” It’s such a good bit that I just ended up keeping one in my party for the entirety of the game, despite its relative lack of usefulness. Little flourishes — like the hug animation that has my character put their entire head into the wide-mouthed grin of a slime monster — have further endeared the game’s many adorable creatures to me.\n\nAn image of a camp in Palworld. It shows more than a dozen creatures working on tasks like mining or gardening. Many of the Pals are clipping into each other and overlapping. \nThe camps can definitely get a bit messy and crowded. Image: Pocketpair via Polygon\nThese Pals play a central role in progressing the game as well. Palworld rewards players with additional experience points for catching the first 10 specimens of any given species of Pal, which incentivized me to snap up as many Pals as possible. For context, crafting items might give you only six or so experience points, whereas taking a few moments to go catch a weak level 4 Lamball could award upward of 500 experience points. Leveling up my character is a massively important aspect of the game since it lets me upgrade stats like stamina, attack, or health, and unlock the schematics to create vital technology for my base and crafting recipes. For example, you need to be level 26 to unlock a generator, which is a requirement to level up the base.\n\nBecause I need to catch loads of Pals to level up my character, progression feels largely locked to the amount of Pals I can catch, which in turn is tied to the number and variety of Pal spheres I can make to catch them. In this way, Palworld’s progression system has a domino effect whereby I need certain kinds of ore to create Pal spheres, which in turn requires me to set up mines on my base or level up so I can build a second base to mine a specific ore, which then requires specific technology to keep Pals happy and working. Once I craft the right spheres, I can then go and explore the region and catch as many Pals as possible.\n\nAn image of a Gumoss, a slimey creature from Palworld, hugging a character. The giant creature is using its tongue to lick the character’s head.\nI did not expect for my character to fully put its head into this Pal’s mouth when I went in for the hug. Image: Pocketpair via Polygon\nThe result is that progression in Palworld isn’t all that flexible. At times, I wanted to focus on just exploring or only catching Pals, but those actions wouldn’t level up my character or provide me with the resources I needed. So, to continue my progress, I really had to focus on making spheres and then upgrades that supported my player-character in exploring regions with new Pals, so I could in turn get more experience points. While it could feel limiting if someone wanted to hone in on a specific element of the game, this progression system also gives a potentially unwieldy game an overall sense of structure, even as it includes so many varying forms of gameplay.\n\nIn its early days post-launch, many players dinged Palworld for its perceived lack of originality. The game clearly pulls influences from several games that I listed in the introduction. But Palworld doesn’t just “steal” game concepts in a way that comes across as a pure copy-and-paste. Instead, it’s more like the developers have taken aspects from so many of these games I’ve grown up with, and they’ve placed them into a revolving door of varied gameplay that results in a coherent loop.\n\nThe miracle of Palworld isn’t its popularity, it’s that it exists at all\nPalworld has kicked off a messy but fascinating debate on animal cruelty in games\nGreg is actually Palworld’s most concerning Pal\nBetter yet, the elements of Palworld that are clearly inspired by other games have allowed me to approach the game’s multiplayer with a shared vernacular. While playing in co-op with my brother, before we learned the actual names of the Pals, we would sometimes call each one by the name of its Pokémon lookalike. One time, I actually started hollering as my brother desperately shrieked at me to “res” him because a Pal had knocked him out, as if we were running around in a Fortnite match.\n\nThis game is trying to do a lot, and it has several rough edges because of it. Don’t expect the polish and thoroughness in design that would be present in a big-budget AAA game. It doesn’t have the fanciest soundtrack, and while the overworld map is genuinely massive — I can explore volcanic and snow biomes and everything in between — its environments don’t exactly feel imbued with a sense of wonder or mystery. The game is still in early access and it has a lot of bugs. The Pals can easily get stuck while walking around a base, and sometimes my character will get locked in certain animations or bug out if I try to, say, jump while climbing.\n\nStill, I enjoyed my time with Palworld. It had just enough structure and variation between working at my base, exploring, and catching Pals, throughout which I relished the fact that it all worked. It’s a game that’s pushed me to rethink what kinds of games and genres can and do fit together. At times, the game buckled under its massive scope; certain systems glitch or play like works in progress. Still, this Frankenstein’s monster of a video game contains a survival adventure that’s both tough and surprisingly joyful. It’s only in early access, but I can’t wait to see what’s in store for the future of Palworld.

This is yet another take on the bullet-hell survival formula established by Vampire Survivors, using the sci-fi setting of the original Deep Rock Galactic. It’s a combination that works as well as chocolate and peanut butter. I’ve spent hours fleeing from bugs and mining valuable ore, and yet every time I step away, I find myself yearning for the mines.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic: Survivor starts with only one of the four dwarves from the original game available, the Scout. The Scout teaches the player the basics of the game, using his enhanced mobility to flee the bugs while whittling them down with steady automatic arms fire. Each round begins with a drop pod landing deep in the mines, and the dwarf emerges with a starting weapon and a couple of objectives: collect resources from around the map and draw out the elite boss by slaying wave after wave of an unstoppable alien swarm.\n\nThe Scout starts with a simple assault rifle, but the longer I played, the more of an arsenal I unlocked. I gained XP from mining and killing bugs; every time I leveled up, I got a small upgrade like movement speed, fire rate on my weapon, or more damage. At certain milestones, I unlocked the option for a new weapon — perhaps a cryo grenade if I’m dealing with swarms, or a high-powered sniper rifle to eliminate tough targets. The weapons automatically fire, but go down while they reload. I needed to keep an eye on my ammo, watch my positioning, and collect all of the goodies on the map without being overwhelmed by monsters.\n\nA Driller sprays flame and acid all around him in powerful gouts during a round of Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor\nImage: Funday Games/Ghost Ship Publishing\nOccasionally, the Deep Rock Galactic corporation was kind enough to give me a supply drop. I had to find these beacons and clear the area around them, then wait for the drop itself to come down. If I was successful, I got an artifact — something like an ammo clip that gives me a much higher fire rate at the cost of attack speed, or the chance to find gold in any rock I happen to mine. If I had to abandon the supply beacon to save my life, it smarted — and the rest of the run was much tougher as a result.\n\nDuring my first few rounds, I took the time to find my feet and didn’t worry too much about advancing. This is a game where you will die early and often — and that’s just part of the fun. Every time I died, I returned to the main menu, where I could unlock new permanent upgrades with the resources I earned during my last match. The next time I went down, I was stronger, faster, and wiser. I also eventually earned the ability to play as the other classes: the Gunner, Engineer, and Driller.\n\nWhile the first few rounds of Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor felt a bit samey, the game opened up as I unlocked and played as new classes. Every round, I had some new upgrade to test or a new tool available in the random arsenal. The four classes all play differently as well. While the Scout is a nimble guy who runs and guns, the Gunner is much happier facing down the swarm and allowing his massive minigun to rip through bugs like wet tissue paper; the Engineer drops turrets, creating zones of control; and the Driller is the best miner of the group by far.\n\nA selection of upgrades available in the shop in Deep Rock Galactic, showing ways the players can empower their weapon or dwarf.\nImage: Funday Games/Ghost Ship Publishing\nMining was essential, regardless of class. Valuable minerals were wedged in the rock that I needed for upgrades. Secondly, mining allowed me to create new paths that were critical for survival. If I was wedged up against a rock, with every bug in the universe coming at me to munch my bones, I turned and noped out by tunneling through the stone. The trick is that mining can be slow work, especially when trying to get special resources. The best rounds of Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor are the ones where I beat the odds by clever use of mining to open up new paths, evading the swarm and feeling like a Big Brain Genius in the process.\n\nI’ve rarely spent time in Deep Rock Galactic itself, simply because it’s not a game on rotation for my friend group. But it’s fun to get to approach that world from another angle, one that is more suited for solo play. There’s an amount of brainless joy to the game — all I have to worry about is pointing my dwarf in the right direction, and he will do the rest. All the while, I get the serotonin boost of leveling up and getting neat new guns. I regret to report that instead of brain, there is Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor.\n\n','2024-04-02 03:27:20.000000','Latest',_binary '',85,1,'2024-04-02 03:27:22.225000','2024-04-23 07:41:11.665000',4,49,12,NULL,'STEAM',1600,_binary '\0',NULL,'{\"Overall\":[\"fun and addictive\",\"bullet-hell survival formula\",\"sci-fi setting\",\"brainless enjoyable experience\",\"leveling up\",\"new weapons\"],\"sentiment\":{\"Suggestion\":\"NA\",\"Overall\":\"Positive\",\"Accessibility\":\"Positive\",\"Gameplay\":\"Positive\",\"Narrative\":\"NA\",\"Bug\":\"NA\",\"Price\":\"NA\",\"Sound\":\"\",\"Performance\":\"\",\"Graphics & Art Design\":\"\"},\"Accessibility\":[\"simple controls\",\"easy-to-understand objective\",\"solo play\",\"group play\"],\"Sound\":[],\"Graphics & Art Design\":[\"sci-fi setting\",\"bullet-hell survival formula\",\"visually appealing\"],\"Suggestion\":[],\"Gameplay\":[\"bullet-hell survival\",\"mine resources\",\"fight waves\",\"unlock upgrades\",\"sci-fi setting\",\"dwarf classes\"],\"Narrative\":[\"little story focus\",\"sense of progression\",\"achievement\"],\"Bug\":[],\"Price\":[],\"isSpam\":false,\"Performance\":[\"smoothly\",\"minimal performance issues\"]}','Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a bullet-hell survival game with a sci-fi setting, featuring four dwarf classes and simple controls.

These fights with the creatures feel frantic at points; the combat itself plays like a first-person shooter where I shoot monsters and evade their attacks by rolling around like I would in a Soulslike game. After catching creatures like, say, a giant dinosaur that looks like a rubber toy, I realize my character needs to eat, just as I would in Minecraft. Lucky for me, the food I scavenged up and cooked at my base hasn’t expired yet. I scarf it down and I’m good to go, so I jog over a stretch of a wooded forest to arrive at a new waypoint of the sprawling natural world — just like I would in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.\n\nFor some people, Palworld might be a little too much, and too overwhelming since it brings together elements from so many different games and genres. The fact that the game even functions on a basic level feels like something of a marvel — a sentiment that’s shared by the CEO of Pocketpair, the Japanese indie studio that created Palworld, who described the making of Palworld as a “miracle.” But as a person whose gaming taste has been largely shaped by series like Pokémon, Fortnite, The Legend of Zelda, and Minecraft, the awkward hodgepodge of Palworld feels like it’s tailor-made for me.\n\nPalworld starts with a tutorial that functions like an extended to-do list guiding players up to the first boss fight. Slowly but surely I have worked my way up from picking objects up off the ground to crafting items and harvesting materials, then automating several resource collection processes by continually upgrading my bases and putting my Pokémon-like Pal creatures to work. As I play, I popcorn between managing my base and catching Pals while I explore the game’s overworld.\n\nAn image of a Relaxaurus Pal in Palworld. It looks like a rubber dinosaur. It looks big, dumb, and cute with its vapid stare.\nImage: Pocketpair\nAlthough forcing my Pals to work forms an unavoidable part of the game, the way I catch and play alongside the Pals in the game doesn’t feel all that dark or transgressive — at least, not in the way the game’s ads insinuated. Sure, I can fire the adorable penguin-like Pal, Pengullet, from a rocket launcher and it will explode like a bomb, but the game’s cartoony nature tends to skew more toward absurdity than brutality. Palworld isn’t graphic and it doesn’t seem to encourage the mistreatment of Pals all that much, since I need them to work. If anything, I found the way that its systems explicitly highlight the inherently exploitative relationship between the creatures and the player-character to be refreshing, even if the game’s writing doesn’t offer any particular commentary on that relationship.\n\nI released a Relaxaurus, the big dumb rubber dino I caught earlier, onto my base for the first time and just hollered when I saw it completely dwarf all the Pals and blankly stare at them with a look that screamed, “I have exactly two brain cells and I am using both of them to water your damn berries.” Then there’s Depresso, a sullen cat who requires constant chemical motivation, provided by pressing F to give it a “caffeine inoculation.” It’s such a good bit that I just ended up keeping one in my party for the entirety of the game, despite its relative lack of usefulness. Little flourishes — like the hug animation that has my character put their entire head into the wide-mouthed grin of a slime monster — have further endeared the game’s many adorable creatures to me.','2024-04-17 06:41:25.000000','Latest',_binary '',85,1,'2024-04-17 06:41:28.897000','2024-04-17 06:42:00.997000',3,48,367,NULL,'STEAM',600,_binary '\0',NULL,'{\"Overall\":[\"fascinating blend\",\"quirky charm\",\"polished mechanics\",\"tailor-made gaming tastes\",\"overwhelming nature\"],\"sentiment\":{\"Suggestion\":\"NA\",\"Overall\":\"Positive\",\"Accessibility\":\"Positive\",\"Gameplay\":\"Positive\",\"Narrative\":\"NA\",\"Bug\":\"NA\",\"Price\":\"NA\",\"Sound\":\"NA\",\"Performance\":\"NA\",\"Graphics & Art Design\":\"Positive\"},\"Accessibility\":[\"cartoony nature\",\"overwhelming for some\",\"highlight exploitative relationship\"],\"Sound\":[\"NA\"],\"Graphics & Art Design\":[\"combine art styles\",\"cartoony aesthetics\",\"detailed environments\",\"adorable creatures\",\"expressive designs\"],\"Suggestion\":[\"NA\"],\"Gameplay\":[\"game elements combined\",\"capture creatures\",\"fight them\",\"manage resources\",\"open world\",\"awkward hodgepodge\"],\"Narrative\":[\"not significant focus\",\"tutorial introduction\",\"exploitative relationship\",\"no commentary\"],\"Bug\":[\"NA\"],\"Price\":[\"NA\"],\"isSpam\":false,\"Performance\":[\"NA\"]}','Palworld is a game that combines elements from Pokémon, first-person shooters, Soulslikes, Minecraft, and Breath of the Wild, with cartoony graphics and an exploitative relationship theme.

And as it turns out, that experience translates quite well to a single-player, top-down approach in Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor. The pacing can be a little hectic as of its Early Access launch, but the exciting weapons, vicious enemies, rewarding progression, and overall good vibes had me ready to get back below ground as many times as the company would let me.\n\nHaving put hundreds of hours into Vampire Survivors, Holocure, and other games in this growing roguelite genre, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is familiar enough that I was able to hit the ground running, but also immediately sets itself apart from them. Starting as one of four distinct classes with auto-firing weapons, you deploy into a hostile environment to squash endless insectoid enemies. The unique angle Survivor brings to that formula is mining, as you\'ll need to dig up gold and nitra to buy upgrades between floors, harvest rare minerals to unlock permanent upgrades on the main menu, and rush to collect specific resources on each floor to complete a bonus objective for a big payout.\n\nI wasn\'t sure if Deep Rock Galactic\'s charm would translate so well when playing all by myself, since the original is very much based on comradery and cooperation. But from energetic dialogue barks to the bombastic soundtrack, Survivor definitely delivers on those good vibes. Deep Rock is almost a subculture of its own within multiplayer co-op at this point, and there are plenty of welcome little nods to the community and player-made memes that show this spin-off was thoughtfully put together.\n\nMy favorite class is, unsurprisingly, the same one I usually play in the shooter version: the Gunner. It simply never gets old mowing down hordes and hordes of bugs with a torrent of lead from up to four different nozzles. Survivor also introduces the concept of reloading to this genre, though – and since you can\'t trigger a reload manually, you have to keep a careful eye on your ammo bars and plan ahead if it looks like two or more guns are going to hit empty at the same time.\n\nBecause of this, I found myself prioritizing reload time upgrades out of the randomized options I could pick from at each level up, which was an interesting new dimension to crafting a successful build for tough runs. Especially playing as the Gunner, whose best weapons reload very slowly by default, it could be the main difference between being a walking death machine and getting completely overwhelmed. And it\'s just as satisfying as it is in any other Survivors-style game when you hit that point of lethal critical mass and can simply meander around the map annihilating everything in your path.\n\nThe Engineer has a quite different and engaging playstyle as well, relying mostly on stationary turrets that spawn around you when you\'re standing still, which then disappear after a short time. I found this class especially difficult to play at first, since the bonus objectives and special enemies on each map often require you to move around a lot. But once I got the hang of looping swarms around obstacles and placing my turrets for maximum effect, I started to enjoy how different the Engineer was from the other three options. It only gets more fun when you unlock multiple turret types later on as well, like ones that chain lightning between them and make for a potent trap.\n\nThen you have the Driller, who is all about digging through solid surfaces to channel enemies into death traps or escape dicey situations. I found that if I could get one specific upgrade that grants you XP every time you break a rock, I was almost playing a different game, sweeping the entire map with my spinny arms and mostly ignoring enemies. It\'s a totally unique way to snowball. Each class also has unlockable specializations that can completely change your playstyle, like making the Gunner into what really amounts to a bearded battle tank.\n\nThere\'s also the Scout. He\'s… fine. A totally okay starter class, but one I found far less interesting than everyone you unlock later.\n\nOne way that Survivor is a bit less satisfying than the original Deep Rock Galactic is that the delves are so short – just a couple minutes each. This makes it very sessionable, but it also got on my nerves a little on certain maps when I really wanted to do more exploring, or had to get a bunch of specific items for a bonus objective, and I was out of time before I felt like I\'d even gotten started. I\'d love to see some longer levels or maybe even an endless mode in future updates.\n\nThe short runs are even more apparent when you factor in that rare minerals are the only way to unlock permanent upgrades, and they represent another thing for you to get distracted by that could jeopardize meeting bonus objectives. You need specific minerals for each category of upgrades, like Jadiz for bonus XP, but you can trade different minerals at a two-to-one rate or buy them outright. That’s a helpful inclusion, because it means will slowly climb up the meta progression ladder simply from earning cash even if you\'re not going for those mineral veins proactively.\nThere are also only three biomes so far: the eerie Crystalline Caverns, boiling Magma Core, and overgrown Hollow Bough, each with their own set of enemies, obstacles, and opportunities. There are five hazard levels to unlock for each that introduce new enemies and bosses, as well as interesting milestone objectives to strive for like upgrading a specific weapon to its max rank. These nicely encouraged me to try out new playstyles and get out of my usual routine.\n\nHowever, it did feel like I ran out of stuff to do pretty quickly. It took me around six hours to clear every level on the default difficulty, and by that point I had already unlocked all of the classes and most of the alternate specializations. After maybe a dozen hours, I didn\'t feel like the rewards I was getting were worth continuing to grind for – though that central shooting and looting remained fun on its own.','2024-04-22 13:38:26.000000','Latest',_binary '',86,1,'2024-04-22 13:38:31.611000','2024-04-22 13:39:09.300000',3,49,3,NULL,'STEAM',3600,_binary '\0',NULL,'{\"Overall\":[\"unique roguelite game\",\"mining mechanic\",\"distinct classes\",\"auto-firing weapons\",\"variety of enemies\",\"short levels\",\"annoyance\"],\"sentiment\":{\"Suggestion\":\"Negative\",\"Overall\":\"Positive\",\"Accessibility\":\"Positive\",\"Gameplay\":\"Positive\",\"Narrative\":\"NA\",\"Bug\":\"NA\",\"Price\":\"NA\",\"Sound\":\"NA\",\"Performance\":\"Positive\",\"Graphics & Art Design\":\"Positive\"},\"Accessibility\":[\"accessible\",\"familiar genre\",\"distinct classes\",\"helpful inclusions\",\"trading minerals\",\"buying minerals\",\"meta progression\"],\"Sound\":[],\"Graphics & Art Design\":[\"three biomes\",\"unique enemies\",\"obstacles\",\"opportunities\",\"distinct appearances\",\"unique upgrades\"],\"Suggestion\":[\"longer levels\",\"endless mode\",\"future updates\"],\"Gameplay\":[\"four classes\",\"unique playstyles\",\"short runs\",\"mining\",\"upgrades\",\"biomes\",\"hazard levels\",\"specialized upgrades\",\"turrets\",\"sessionable format\",\"longer levels\",\"endless mode\"],\"Narrative\":[\"limited narrative\",\"sci-fi setting\",\"dwarf crew\",\"hostile environments\",\"distinct stories\"],\"Bug\":[],\"Price\":[],\"isSpam\":false,\"Performance\":[\"runs well\",\"no major performance issues\",\"hundreds of hours\",\"mining mechanic\",\"reload time upgrades\"]}','Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a unique roguelite game with four classes, short mining runs, and three hazardous biomes.
