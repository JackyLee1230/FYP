       "\"'Thea' is definitely good for several play-throughs, and worth the money at full price.&nbsp;The quest writing, the music and the voice talent are all really, really excellent. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. The game has the potential of becoming a classic, 5 stars, a really great game, if they add more quests and if they balance the early, mid- and end-game better.&nbsp;By the end-game, I am winning all fights/quests easily on auto-resolve, however this may be due to the AI fighting my side using the best card combos? Also, it would be great if you could start play as the other races, e.g., Orcs, Goblins, Elves and Dwarves and not always have to start as humans (this would requiring play balancing as the other races are typically stronger and end-game characters). Try it, you will like it if you like games like Civ, and especially if you like card combat games.  I have played 'Thea' all the way through three times now.&nbsp;It took me about a day each time, but I was progressively making it harder each time.&nbsp; I haven't really figured out the card combat that well,&nbsp;but there is a good tutorial on their wiki site.&nbsp;If you like card combat it looks quite interesting to try and figure out (I just have never gotten into it).&nbsp;Your RP characters are your 'cards' and at the beginning of a engagement they are split into two decks, offense and tactical.&nbsp; Playing the offense cards is obvious but playing the tactical abilities of your characters/cards takes some learning.&nbsp; There is one round of laying out cards, and then two rounds or combat, and if there are still characters left, you start over again.&nbsp; However, you don't have to do the card combat, as you can auto-resolve all engagements.&nbsp; Once I have built up a reasonably tough 'expedition' team, I mostly just auto-resolve&nbsp;engagements.&nbsp;This also makes the game go much faster, if that is your desire.&nbsp;  &nbsp;Below are a few things I learned on each play-through.&nbsp;You can start the game as many times as you want for the first turn, so try to start with at least three materials to gather within your town's zone of 7 hexes, i.e., vegetables and wood and another building material besides wood, like sandstone, clay, or granite (in that order), and herbs, leathers and/or metals are also very good. Don't leave your town undefended as you only get one town.&nbsp;Keep gathering and&nbsp;producing things as much as possible every turn.&nbsp;More production leads directly to more research points.&nbsp;Use your earned research points allocation smartly between resources you can gather (look at resource map first), crafting new items (don't pick swords if you don't have metals, etc.), and building your ten buildings.&nbsp;I tend to build several gardens first to attract human children and adults and destroy them later to build different buildings or better gardens (using better materials). Do craft better gathering and crafting tools as soon as possible, the better materials you&nbsp;use the more effective the tool/weapon/armor/shield/charm is.&nbsp;  Try to construct buildings as quickly as possible (but the better materials you use the more benefits they give so try gathering those first, which means you may have to select them first with your research points, so plan ahead).&nbsp; Trying the&nbsp;different construction materials for buildings&nbsp;is also fun, as some might give you access to children, Humans, Elves, Goblins, Beasts, etc., depending on the type of material you have available and use.&nbsp; Or you might get a much&nbsp;better sword or armor by changing up the materials (three types per item).&nbsp; You have an unlimited&nbsp;party size, so outfitting your RPG characters is lots of fun assigning&nbsp;weapons, armor, charms, tools, etc. There are weight constrictions (strength) on how much each character can&nbsp;carry, so pay attention to that when assigning armor, etc.&nbsp; You have to take wood (&lt;10) and food (as much as you can spare while leaving carrying capacity, in other words, your expedition, between its outfit, wood and food should equal about half you carry weight,&nbsp;so that you have capacity to carry back stuff you have gathered or gained in fights/quests).&nbsp;   While building a party of mostly warriors with stats in&nbsp;damage, armor and shielding will work, you should also bring along other characters in your expedition(s) that have other stats (herbalism, divination, dexterity, sneak, magic, etc.), because you can solve quests not&nbsp;just by&nbsp;fighting, but also in&nbsp;other ways.&nbsp;In other words, a fight against a dragon might be 5 skulls versus 2 skulls to sneak past him if you have that skill improved on a couple of characters.&nbsp;I like to take a mix of fighters, hunters, a medic (so you can camp and heal while out of town), and any other beings you collect along the way through quests (e.g., Witches, Humans, Elves, Goblins, Beasts, Demons, Giants, Trolls, Orcs, Dwarves, etc.).&nbsp;Camp immediately after an engagement during which your party members were seriously wounded, or they may die.&nbsp;   There are two primary quests, one&nbsp;for your god and the other to quell the giants, do those carefully as they are both worth extra&nbsp;victory points. If you play on the lowest two difficulty&nbsp;settings you can save before most&nbsp;every quest, fight, etc., that you initiate,&nbsp;so you&nbsp;can replay if you screw it up.&nbsp; However engagements can be initiated during the AI's turn, and they frequently are, sometimes several in a row, so save often.&nbsp;If you play on the last two settings, you do not get to save then you permanently suffer the consequences of the quest results if you lose (cursed, killed, wounded, sick, etc.).&nbsp;On the other hand, since many of the quests repeat, most of the fun is in the first play-through when you don't know which paths work best to choose when answering the quest's questions.&nbsp; There are different consequences (I.e., better rewards or more painful results if you choose A, B, C, or D). It is worth continuing to keep playing after you have 'won' to build up the victory points for the total for that god (there are 8 in all that give you different starting benefits).  When crafting items, there are typically&nbsp;two types of ingredients and&nbsp;one catalyst.&nbsp; You have different choices of materials for the first ingredient and then again for the second ingredient&nbsp;(and sometimes they overlap, e.g., you could use wood and sandstone, or wood and wood).&nbsp;The catalyst only affects the quality (but only after you have built the smithy, so only use wood until you do). Coal and gold make good catalyst. Never destroy items, instead break them down into their components to reuse, preferably in town so you don't have to carry them around, but you will have to do this at times while on an expedition to keep below your carrying capacity.&nbsp;Your party eats one food per turn and burns one wood per camping turn (to stay warm and cook food).&nbsp;They don't burn wood while moving but they do eat food while moving. You have to camp to gather materials and to heal (very important as new characters are slow to&nbsp;be attracted to your town&nbsp;in the early game).&nbsp;You can move 5 hexes per turn, but there are terrain affects (though apparently&nbsp;just for movement and&nbsp;not for combat).&nbsp; You can barely move&nbsp;or cannot move at&nbsp;all,&nbsp;if&nbsp;one of your party is&nbsp;carrying too much weight. Inventory control for the expedition party is important, compare items and disassembly the poor quality ones. Keep an eye on the weight of an item&nbsp;as well as its&nbsp;other stats, as a level 20 axe may&nbsp;look great, but not if it weights 200 pounds and none of your low level characters can carry it. Warriors can carry a two-handed sword in one hand and a shield in the other,&nbsp;while Dwarves can carry a two-handed hammer in one hand and a shield in the other&nbsp;(and you would think that Orcs could then carry a two-handed axe, but they can't, go figure). Anyway, you can tell I enjoyed the game. Have fun! \""

      "WARNING TL:DR POST  I'm going to be incredibly critical of this game, I love this game and it is fun, but it lacks. You NEED mods to play this game. (Some mods can/may fix some of these issues)  How this game lacks/requires to fix:   &gt;Working testudo - one that doesn't die when under missile fire (the whole point of a testudo). Ironically, this was done perfectly in Rome 1, so why the backwards step?  &gt;Working hoplite phalanx - a phalanx is supposed to be a tank when attacking from the front, but in the current game it's average against swordsmen &amp; will die easy against good sword men - it's only supposed to be weak when flanked. Rome 1 wasn't a perfect display of a hoplite phalanx, but it displayed the phalanx traits well.  &gt;Working Pike Phalanx - The whole idea of a pike phalanx was to pin, whilst other troops - such as cav or melee inf - flank &amp; kill. In Rome 2, pre-emperor patch, the pike phalanx was impenetrable and did big damage, now post-patch, it is easily penetrable and does low damage. It is simply supposed to be impenetrable and do low damage (with rising damage according to troop quality). Rome 1 mods mastered this very basic mechanic well, so why does a professional company like CA (the actual creators) fail repeatedly?   &gt;Garrisons in settlements SHOULD be RECRUITABLE. In the game, you build a building and may get, say a unit of slingers added to the garrison. If it's a high-risk of invasion settlement, then you may need to park an army inside the settlement, perhaps permanently. BUT, you only have a limited number of armies, so you may get into a situation where you cannot simply move, or that the majority of your armies cannot move, EVEN if you can afford more armies, purely due to the illogical and arbitrary 'max number of armies' imposition. This is why you should be able to recruit into a garrison, as well as an army. Say, if you recruit into a garrison, then that garrison army cannot be used offensively. Fair enough. That means that you only get a max number of OFFENSIVE armies according to the size of your imperium, which would be more logical than simply a max number of armies. (People have suggested simply being able to peel of individual units from an army and have the ability to place them in a settlement)  &gt;Edicts - they should have NO max number. The bonuses you get from edicts are so very meagre, sometimes negligible. Having a max of only a few negligible bonuses is ridiculous. Tax harvesting was only 5%, which was nothing. Now it's 15%. but that's still hardly any. If my province is making 1000 per turn, that's only an extra 150 gold. Which is not enough to buy anything. It is a nothing amount. Even late game when a really good, expanded settlement is developed, and is worth 3000 for the whole province, then thats only an extra 450. 450 gold late game is also negligible because in late game everything is expensive. POINTLESS. If you were guaranteed 1 edict per completely-owned province, then those negligible amounts could at least add up.  &gt;Roman legions - they don't use legionary tactics and do not steam roller the barbarians, like how they should. IT WOULD make the game imbalanced in favour of Rome, but that's the whole point, and THAT would additionally offer a real challenge to anyone playing as another faction - to fight the mighty rome and actually win. Due to the ridiculous 'kill animations' required to complete a kill, you will never be able to have the 3 soldiers on 1, kind of scenerio, which is what that era of warefare was all about. Rome 1 was on a basic engine, but it displayed this warefare PERFECTLY. If some legionaries were fighting a barbarian unit, then they could gang up on the last guy.   &gt;Arrows and missiles: in M2TW if you were on a hill and fired atop it, then you got a range bonus, depending on the height you were firing from: the higher you were (in comparison to the enemy unit) the greater the range bonus. This could translate into a few archers actually throwing back a larger force, that could not otherwise win, if it wasnt for the hill - a kind of agincourt-esque scenerio. Of course, when you were firing up-hill, then the opposite would be true - your arrows' range would be reduced depending on the steepness of the hill. On Rome 2, it's ALWAYS the same. Also the missile units can only fire in front of them. (because their 'target zone' is a partial section of a circle shape. In old tw games, they had a 360 degree angle of attack. So if an enemy got behind your lines, then they could PIVOT on the spot and shoot behind them. Now they physically have to move and rearrange their formation/positioning, which messes up lines and often leaves them exposed. It is just madness. Also, make the range of their shots on flat ground larger - because they get hardly any kills in before the gap is shut. Or make the units move much slower, if you want the range to be the same.  &gt;Make the size of armies larger (more individual units per army) and/or no limits of number of armies. Yes, I know that that you can have combined allied army battles where you can control up to 40 units at a time, but i mean singular armies. They should have at least 25 - 30 (if not more) max number of units per singular army. THIS would greatly justify having to be forced to have a max number of armies, per imperium size, rather than how much you can afford. (Though tbh, as the seleucids, I maxed out the number of armies and navies mid-end game and just had piles of money sitting there doing nothing. I maxed out buildings and upgrades, as well. So I had well over a million gold in my treasury sat doing NOTHING at the end of every turn. It is logical, that if you can afford more armies, then that should be the ONLY thing holding you back from doing so.  &gt;Diplomatic options for trading provinces/regions (like in old games). I remember playing NTW, and a losing enemy wanted peace. They had nothing to offer, no money, no anything EXCEPT a region. If they didn't offer a region, then I could destroy them. The treaties for peace from war, throughout ALL history has been the trade of land between factions in order to secure that peace. So it should be added. Also TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE tradable, like in empire/napoleon. (I havent played shogun 2 - the area and period do not interest me, so I cannot compare) This meant that if a nation was far ahead in terms of social tech and you were ahead in terms of military tech, that you could TRADE tech, or even concede tech for a PEACE settlement.   &gt;The current UI &amp; faction colours are also awful - they rid the game of the old ones and replaced them with light colours that (at least for me) hurt my eyes after a while, it's just too bright.  &gt;Minor discrepancies such as the seleucid generals screaming 'FOR ROME' as they are attacking an enemy on the campaign map, which is just ridiculous. Also, the ships can still sail through land sometimes (at least the AI's does sometimes) which breaks immersion. Also if you or the enemy attacks by sea with a large force, then you will run out of room to land all your men (as there are 'X' amount of spaces for units to land on, which may mean that you will have to speed up the battle-speed to x3 and wait for like 10 minutes for the clock to run out, or end up losing the battle.   &gt;New Politics system: I don't like it. Personally, I'd like a three-family (or more) kind of system (almost separate factions of the same faction), like in Rome 1, where you all fall under the same banner - Rome - and you all conquer territory for Rome, til one of you becomes popular, then you can seize power in civil war. You could add the politcal actions to this, so you could hinder pleb support for a good rival general or adopt someone to your family, which would affect support and relations with the others. (You control 1 family - their armies, regions, etc - Ai controls other 2.) + add R1: B.I civil war system ON TOP, if public order is bad = civil war\n",
