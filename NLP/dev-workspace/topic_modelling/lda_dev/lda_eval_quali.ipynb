Also, the movement of the character, in addition to the controls, don't feel tight enough, leaving you with a feeling that more could be done with them.

In the game you can deploy up to 6 units, among an adequate variety of units, each with strengths and weaknesess and tactics on how to best use them.

Therefore build the ship with a small fuel cell and a small auto repair module. Equip Ramscoop on external mount. Equip only Lasers or other Energy weapons not requiring ammo.  In battle the ramscoop gets destroyed quickly but the fuel cell will power the ship during combat and the auto repair module will fix the ramscoop in time so that it fixes itself automatically after the battle.\n",
