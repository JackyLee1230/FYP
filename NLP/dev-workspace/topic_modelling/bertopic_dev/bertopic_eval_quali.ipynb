       "{-1: ['9 / 10 i bought this game at a reduced price after reading some very good reviews. i was completely new to the franchise but picked up the game relatively quickly. at the time of wrting this reveiw i have completed the game with one of the three characters and i have just started a new story with a second character on veteran. the veteran option allows you to play the story mode from a level 30 character which was a really nice addition which provided a very different style of gameplay and more features, so it was as if you are getting two games for the price of one. however i was initally confused why i was only level 30 after completing the campaign on casual mode. gamplay functions as a normal rpg should. however i do stuggle with some aspects such as very small action bars ( 1 - 6 ) and the left mouse being responsible for movement and the primary attack which would send me running into a hoarde of enemies instead of attacking them. bosses are challenging and hoardes of enemies can take you down even on the easy settings. the tower defence, chimera and resistence side quests / activities / tasks are a nice aspect of the game which allow you to earn more money and experience whilst keeping you entertained.',\n",
       "  \"this is another game that i just finished. when i started playing this i was immediately hooked at how the game played out like a zelda game some and a metroid game. the graphics were good and the music was great. the dungeon layouts were very good and the bosses were great to fight. now for the downside of this game : this game starts off very simple, but gets harder as you progress, as you take damage you don ' t really have any immunity time so you have to get away from danger as fast as possible making it easy to die. when you die you lose half of your earned gems that you get from opening chests or fighting monsters making it sort of rage but that can easily be fixed by just restarting a fresh save. another thing was the puzzles in this game, sometimes i had to look at the walkthrough ( which sometimes i hate doing ) in order to figure out sometimes what notes to play so having pen and paper is needed for this game. this was a great experience and i ' m glad i finished the 2nd to finish the 1st one.\",\n",

       "  'really a great game, especially for the small price. a lot of the negative reviews seem to spawn from having wipeout - like expectations towards a 10 - euro - game. that´s just unrealistic. for its price, the game is really good. the feeling of speed is great, and while some things tend to be a bit annoying, it makes them feel extra rewarding when you finally manage to win. this would be different if you´d be penaltied for things you have no influence on, but especially boss levels that feel unbeatable and unfair at first become very easy once you figure out the best strategy. for example, if a boss has strong forward - directed weapons, it might best to stay close behind him and overtake him just before the finish line. or, on tight, twisting tracks, you might be able to get an advantage by using all your boost immediately so you are always one turn ahead and lock - on weapons or straight missiles can´t hit you. the only thing the game really lacks is motion blur. but that may still come in a future update. overall, i´d definitely recommend this game if you look for a rather cheap, fun, futuristic racing game.',\n",

( also, the music and the narrator both remind me of firefly, and zulf and zia are both cute. all the characters are cute. did i mention the great art style? ) the combat can be picked up pretty quickly, but mastering it - and the challenges for each weapon - are much harder. i ' d definitely recommend playing this game if you ' re looking for an unusual and creative experience.\",\n",

      "Original: I must admit, I wanted it out of curiosity in the beginning, but I couldn't expect how much fun it could actually be. The fighting system feels fast, responsive, and with a lot of potential for combos, and juggling enemies in the air. Each move you have has a specific purpose and is clearly differentiated from the others, creating a small yet varied set of tools at your disposal. Yet one can't help but think that a couple more moves wpuld help make battles more varied and interesting. The tactical side of things, later on with the addition of shielded and alternate dimension enemies you can't just take them all on at once, you have to be more methodical, to decide which targets are a priority, which should be knocked down for later. The game can be pretty tactical, yet not so much so as to become slow or unenjoyable. The game doesn't ask you to make big plans about each fight, but to assess the situation and make on-the-fly choices to defeat you enemies in the most efficient, safe, fashion. And that makes it actually rather enjoyable. Unfortunately, however, the difficulty from battles comes more from the ammount of enemies rather than the individual enemies themselves. They never really feel dangerous on their own right, all of them being rather slow and having pretty big tells for when they're going to attack, making it easy to avoid them. Instead, the danger comes from having to keep track of a lot of enemies at once. Yet, at the same time, it makes sense, since it helps keep the flow of the game, whereas single, difficult enemies might make it slower. Overall, the combat is good and has quite a lot of potential The art style is indeed pleasing to the eye, it looks really colourful yet clean and simple. It's nice to look at and adds character to the game, it works with it, whereas a more realistic approach, at least in my opinion wouldn't have been half as charming However, one thing the game does suffer from, is it's really short length. I finished the campaign in about ten hours, and I really took my time and 100%'d it. And while it's true that it's better to not overstay your welcome and instead leave a good memory, I'd say Guacamelee!, however, left too early, leaving you wanting more but without much else to do, as the game doesn't really have much in the way of post-game content, other than the El Infierno and Caverna del Pollo challenges. Granted the game does have a good ammount of exploration to do to get all the secrets, it rather goes by fast Another small problem the game has, is it's lack of online co-op capabilities. While it's understanable that it could cause a lot of problems and frustration with an uncoodinated group, it would also be great fun when it worked. It would be a really nice feature to have when your friends aren't available for some Luchador action. As I have rambled a lot, and with purpose of making the list more approachable, I'll include a list of pros and cons: Pros: +Very solid and entertaining fighting style that doesn't get old +Well differentiated moveset where every move has its clear purpose +Lots of enemies that make for varied encounters and strategies to beat them +Colourful and clean artstyle that adds charm to the game and has just enough ammount of detail to not feel boring +The enemies, thanks to the art style are inmediately recognizable, and thus you are rarely confused about what you should do +A good amount of costumes, with their own effects, that allow even more variety in your battles, and in my opinion, look pretty nice +Chickens Cons: -The game suffers from a really short length, leaving you wanting more with no real way to ease that craving -Not much in the way of post-game content. It's a small game -The movelist, although differentiated, is rather small. It could have done with some more moves -The platforming requires good eye-hand coordination late-game. Can become frustrating if you have poor reflexes -A little too heavy on the memes -No online multiplayer support The game, overall, is really good and I enjoyed it inmensely. I'm also impressed in how well the extra areas are included in the game, I didn't know they were add-ons until I looked them up due to how well integrated they are. The only real complain I have about the game is the short lenght. It's a small game, but a really good one. I would definitely recommend it\n",

      "Original: 9/10 I bought this game at a reduced price after reading some very good reviews. I was completely new to the franchise but picked up the game relatively quickly. At the time of wrting this reveiw I have completed the game with one of the three characters and I have just started a new story with a second character on veteran. The veteran option allows you to play the story mode from a level 30 character which was a really nice addition which provided a very different style of gameplay and more features, so it was as if you are getting two games for the price of one. However I was initally confused why I was only level 30 after completing the campaign on casual mode. Gamplay functions as a normal RPG should. however I do stuggle with some aspects such as very small action bars (1-6) and the left mouse being responsible for movement and the primary attack which would send me running into a hoarde of enemies instead of attacking them. Bosses are challenging and hoardes of enemies can take you down even on the easy settings. The tower defence, chimera and resistence side quests/activities/tasks are a nice aspect of the game which allow you to earn more money and experience whilst keeping you entertained. Sometimes the game crashes which is inconveinient but it hasn't drastically affected my gameplay. The amount of choice is with regard to skills and items is mind boggling. It is as if each item is compeltely unique and offers a different range of stats which is great however it can become time consuming to make a decision as to what you want to equip. There are excellent features in the options that allow you to automatically equip the best items though. The skill tree/ tricks/ auras are fairly large for both you and your ghostly companion and as such I spent a lot of time make decisions about how to spend my skill/ability points. Overall it is pleasure to play and will probably keep me entertained for 2 or 3x the time I have already played. Thanks! (This was the first review I've ever wrote so feedback is welcome)\n",

      "Original: This is another game that I just finished. When I started playing this I was immediately hooked at how the game played out like a Zelda game some and a Metroid game. The graphics were good and the music was great. The dungeon layouts were very good and the bosses were great to fight. Now for the downside of this game: this game starts off very simple, but gets harder as you progress, as you take damage you don't really have any immunity time so you have to get away from danger as fast as possible making it easy to die. When you die you lose half of your earned gems that you get from opening chests or fighting monsters making it sort of rage but that can easily be fixed by just restarting a fresh save. Another thing was the puzzles in this game, sometimes I had to look at the walkthrough (which sometimes I hate doing) in order to figure out sometimes what notes to play so having pen and paper is needed for this game. This was a great experience and I'm glad I finished the 2nd to finish the 1st one.\n",

      "Original: SO, yesterday I had one of the devs connect to my stream, that was kinda neat and rather novel. Either I am going to review this game cuz I know it helps out. This game has somewhat simple artwork, it's good, but simple. This is not so much a bad thing as an observation. Ever playe dthose strange arcade games like Gals Panic? There are many semi popular japanese games that play this way and Luminosity very much reminds me of these games. Instead of drawing the lines you shoot a laster that goes across the playfield. The game is fun and worth having for short distractions for sure but it's not like it's too deep or varied in gameplay. All in all I would say this game is a win overall but don't expect some major timekilling AAA here. The fact that there are multiple types of ships that have other abilities, shoot lasers and the powerups go a long way in keeping this game from getting boring. Overall I would give this and above average score when compared to other small indie style games. A out of 10. If you think you might like it, get it, it's cheap!\n",

      "Original: I would have to say that this is one of the best games in the Call Of Duty franchise. I got this game on console a few years back and I've had it on PC for a few years as well. The Campaign is very fun and worth playing. It take about 6-7 hours to complete, but has some intense and epic moments, along with an amazing ending. The Multiplayer is still very active. I don't play it much but there are many servers out there, most having friendly communitites. It is mainly TDM servers however, so there is a lack of variety. There are a good amount of high XP servers which you can play to rank up quickly, in order to get more weapon choices, perks and equipment. Zombies is the primary reason myself and many others bought this game. WAW on PC comes with all DLC free of charge, unlike the console version where you need to pay for DLC. The zombies maps that are avaiable are great fun to play on your own, but playing with friends makes the experience far better. The Zombies experience does not end there though. You can download community created maps online and play them aswell. There are literally thousands of maps to choose from. If you wanted to, you could create your own using tools like Radient and upload them to websites dedicated to providing downloads to zombies maps. Overall, this game is fantastic. I would get it on sale if I were you however. This game is 8 years old now and should be worth less than £20. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into COD or wants to go back to boots on the ground gameplay.\n",

      "Original: Terraria, what can I say about it? it is pure awesomeness and it something that seems to never let me down. The variety of features within the game is just astounding. It is a total pleasure to just play this game, and for a cheap price, even better! There are several features which just make it so much fun, and in my opinion, it is not a minecraft rip off, yes, it may have taken a few ideas off them, but in the end result, it is so much more different than minecraft. The different variety in items is just amazing, the different collections of furniture, armor, weapons, guns, and so much more! It makes me want to keep playing just so I can get it all. There is also a multiplayer feature which makes it a lot more fun to play. It makes things more active and fun within the game when you are playing in a server with a lot of people in it, atleast a minimum of 3, I would say, makes it an exhilarating experience for everyone. The combat system, though it is a bit annoying at times, is quite good for a 2D game such as Terraria, though it can get on your nerves at times, but that is something you can Most of the The bosses in the game provide a good challenge even with a good amount of equipment which are at high quality, they are tricky to fight which gives the player a annoying, yet fun experience overall. It makes me want to keep fighting till I can actually beat them. The NPC's, something which I quite liked in this game, they come only when you fullfil certain requirements which was quite nice to see, providing an extra challenge to the player, since most NPC's provide either information, or items for sale. It just creates more of a challenge which once gaain, increases the overall experience! However, though there are many good things, I do dislike the fact that there is no proper story to he game, yes, some people may enjoy that, but, on the other hand, do not. I would wish for a proper story to play, but there is none, That is all I really have to say right now, I highly recommend this game to simply either play with friends, or by yourself as a pass time, but be warned, it is extremely addicting!\n",

While I was a big fan of the single-player campaign in the original Half-Life these new stories that have been unveiling beginning with with Half-Life 2 just haven't been quite as impressive and Episode One feels much the same way. The story picks up shortly after the end of Half-Life 2 proper. Through the power of being the protagonist you have somehow manged to survive and must now fight your way out of the city before it implodes on you. There is not much new to the storyline or gameplay and the areas feel like they could have been ripped straight out of the regular Half-Life 2 campaign. Of course there is a certain bias from me because I never bought Half-Life 2 to play Half-Life 2, that was just a nice little bonus, I bought it for the mods and as such I am not nearly as invested as others in the lives of Alyx and her boytoy Gordon. Get it if you liked the single-player campaign in Half-Life 2 and want a few more hours of it. Otherwise you can safely ignore it as it's an entirely forgettable expansion.\n",

      "Original: An amazing follow-up to Assassins Creed that fixes most if not all of the flaws and gives you a beautiful new city to play around in. The story is solid but does feel a little spread out at times. The transitions between story segments in and out of the animus is really top notch in this one. Plot on both sides always felt relevent, something I think lacked from most AC games after this one. I really enjoyed the characters, the main cast is funny and relatable but still manages to feel mostly period accurate. Graphics are great for their time and really hold up for the most part. Environment feels alive and by the time I got to play it most of the bugs were ironed out. Cities feel big, churches and streets are fun to explore just to see the art work on the inside. Gameplay is solid, its not the best in AC to date but it is a great improvement over the original and is still fun to play. Missions are fun and varied, for the most part. You will still notice repeats of certain types of missions, go here kill that, go here get that, and the god awefull tailing missions that I still hate. Blending in with crowds feels silly, maybe thats just me, but if an armed dude walked up to me and some friends while we were talking, I dont think we would just continue the conversation. Combat is varied, fun, and satisfying. At a certain point the mission is combat is not to stay alive, its to make a spectacle of slaughtering your enemy. This is where ACII really shines. Planning out an assult and following through is one of the most satisfying parts of this game. Aside from some annoying tailing mission and some minor glitches ACII is a beautiful, immersive, and fun game that I would reccommend to just about anyone.\n",

      "Original: Nice atmospheric single player mission. Awesome story, graphics and sound. It's fairly easy to complete, it's over in about 8 hours. The levels are linear so there's no exploring. The combat style is comparable to Assassins Creed or Batman, just with a whole lot more blood, flying limbs and gore. The two player arena is what really keeps me playing now, it's so much fun. Earning more credits to buy more gear for the gladiator. It's a great challenge in survival mode. I'd say the game is worth the 40$ - otherwise wait untill it's on sale. Either way the game is absolutely worth getting.\n",

      "Original: Really a great game, especially for the small price. A lot of the negative reviews seem to spawn from having Wipeout-like expectations towards a 10-euro-game. That´s just unrealistic. For its price, the game is really good. The feeling of speed is great, and while some things tend to be a bit annoying, it makes them feel extra rewarding when you finally manage to win. This would be different if you´d be penaltied for things you have no influence on, but especially boss levels that feel unbeatable and unfair at first become very easy once you figure out the best strategy. For example, if a boss has strong forward-directed weapons, it might best to stay close behind him and overtake him just before the finish line. Or, on tight, twisting tracks, you might be able to get an advantage by using all your boost immediately so you are always one turn ahead and lock-on weapons or straight missiles can´t hit you. The only thing the game really lacks is motion blur. But that may still come in a future update. Overall, I´d definitely recommend this game if you look for a rather cheap, fun, futuristic racing game.\n",

Yes there are some bugs, I have not come across many but I have experienced a few. The story isn't great either but the latest Assassins Creed games did not have very good stories, so people can't blame this game alone.

I really like it in an overall point of view, but lack in some other categories. PROS. -Great Soundtrack. -Nice character design. -THANKS for the japanese voices and subs. -Two character at the same time, this is nice because you can at least sense a little more of 'strategy and control' over the battlefield. -Nice and cool videos. -Good story progression. -Nice clan stories. -Good abilities and unique powers for each character. -Good challenging game in Hard Mode, good relaxing game in Easy or Normal Mode. CONS. -Expensive and really not useful DLC's -BAD BAD BAD button mapping while using a controller, this games are intended to be played with a controller, playing this with a keyboard/mouse is TERRIBLE. I recommend using a gamepad but you need to learn the buttons yourself, and sometimes the counterattacks and special attacks are hard because you need to remember which button do each thing. -Short story mode :( -Weak fighting system, I know it is a hack & slash game but KOEI needs to make a change in this, not adding more powers or giving the enemies a harder punch, I would like to see a little more of strategy and control from the player over the field and one on one battles. I feel sorry to see the lame cavalry only charging toward nothing specific or archers units being killed without remorse without doing anything special, just standing there. The minor soldiers don't have a purpose, and the bannermen are useless, you only kill them as soon as possible and say goodbye to the challenge, another weak unit are the barrack captains, these guys don't feel to have any important role more than morale it would be good to see these guys having an impact in numbers and -I don't like the weapon system on these Samurai Warrior, it's hard to understand and a little complicated, we only want to have the best weapons possible as soon as possible and destroy everything with amazing powers. In older Dynasty Warriors games KOEI used a Level Weapon system, where you started with an odd looking weapons in level 1, but while you complete missions and kill units your character level up an you weapon do it also, changing in stats and appearance I REALLY LIKED this kind of and the changing look in the weapons was like an achievements. (Obviously you needed to to something special in certain map to get the ultimate weapon) Personally I like this game, it could be better but is fun to play. It would be a but it's really annoying the buttton mapping broken system. If you stop playing for a time you will forgot the buttons and you'll need to decipher each one AGAIN!\n",

      "Original: 'Orcs Must Die!' is a well designed indie game to play a fast round without thinking of playing 'CS: GO' instead. Desc: You have a portal with (dependent on difficulty level) 20 lifes, each orc getting into it decreases the life. You goal is to place traps/units and use magic to kill all the orcs without losing any life. At the end you gain skulls for each completed level to upgrade your traps/units. Easy as that. Pros: + 'Pointless' killing orcs + Humorously dialogs/story + Awesome level design (no level is the same and each level has its own gimmicks) + Active melee and ranged fight (sword / crossbow) + Terrific trap and unit design (no pointless traps/units) + 3 magical sections + 3 levels of difficulty + No Bugs/Glitches + Downloadable Demo (+ Achievements [some are hard to get]) (+ DLCs) Cons: - no Multiplayer (there was a lot of potential to have a MP implemented) - I would write more cons, if I would find some ^^ Recommended , but only if it's on sale , because there is still the sequel 'Orcs Must Die 2!'. 9/10\n",

      "Original: Note: I played this game back in 2011, when it had a subscription fee and way before it was released on Steam, so my time recorded on Steam does not reflect my actual experience with the game. Rift plays like a very classic MMORPG akin to World of Warcraft, so if you are familar with traditional RPG game mechanics then you may enjoy your time in the game. It is one of the first games to implement a 'dynamic' world event system that modern games use today. The game is quite polished for its time, however, it is starting to show its age both visually and functionally in comparison to the newer MMORPG's currently on Steam. I wish I could recommend this game to everyone, but the changes in business model have made the game off-putting to invest time in. Although it touts itself to be a F2P game, alot of the content is closed behind a pay wall. I cannot recommend this game to people looking to casually play a F2P game, it just doesn't justify the 20GB+ download. TL;DR A solid traditional MMORPG with a modern dynamic world event system but is run under a poor business model. If F2P is what you are after, then this game is not for you. 5/10\n",

Although new technology has been added, it has very few new things. Notice in Arma OA the large amount of vehicles and weapons? The game makers did not get lazy, but really could have added more. The game is really stable and does not have unexpected crashes, or none that I have had. Arma III gameplay is enough to make me want to take meth however. I understand most missions are player created but really they are all the same 'kill all the Muslims' I understand thats the art of war but most missions are the same. I recommend playing Zues because its more developing now. Overall I recommend Arma III, but just barely. I am not that picky about my games but I felt it needed to be critical with the Arma serious as they do build up a lot of hipe before a game release. I would rank the the game 6/10 , just because of the lack of realism and lack of a dynamic gameplay. In short imagine 20 9/11s, thats arma 3\n",

Honestly, there isn't much I can say that others haven't said already, the game is almost 10 years old now! I mean, wow, that cake meme has existed for so long now. Though I will give my experience with the game; it was fun throughout the whole thing, the puzzles are fun, the dialogue is funny, the advanced maps are fun, the boss battle with GLaDOS is pretty cool, and trying to speed run through Portal is fun. However if you are bad at puzzle games (like me), then you may have to watch/read some walkthroughs in Steam guides or Youtube, afterwards you can show this to your family or friends, and then scream at them for not knowing how to play the game. Replay Value: Not much unless you want to try a Portal speedrun, or earn the achievements 'Transmission Received' and 'Camera Shy'. But let me tell you, some days you're gonna crave some Portal and then finish the game in like, 2 hours. Game time: If it's your first time, you are gonna need a few hours or even days depending on how much time you have on your hands to finish the game, but after a couple more plays or so it will become secondhand nature to you, so then you could try a speedrun or something. Oh, and ACTUAL spoilers this time, but throughout the game, there are secret rooms with creepy music and images painted on the wall, see if you can find 'em all . The only con I can think of is that the game is short, but the other features compensate for it very well, heck, it's even worth the full price. So yeah, buy this game. :D\n",

      "Original: First impressions (PC): When you start the game it´s a bit confusing because the controls are initially keyboard, no mouse control to set gamma/graphics, make menu choices etc. When checking out controls in the options menu you´ll get a picture of an Xbox-controller, with settings for each button, which is weird. No mouse controls in any menu. That seems to be the case throughout the game, only some menu-actions are done by mouse, the rest with keyboard (or perhaps gamepad, In the game it is no problem controlling with mouse and keyboard though (only some irritating hints telling you which stick on the gamepad to move, but not which mouse button to The intro is massive, about 1 hour. At first all you can do is move your head and look around as you wake up in a hospital in Cyprus. You get to make your avatar, character, choosing face-style, hair, scars etc. The intro is about fleeing from the hospital, and it is very slow, I was aking to get on, but as usual in MSG you are treated to elaborate dialogues about your history and this and that. It is a bit confusing at first when you have to change from sitting back, watching things play out, only to have to jump in and steer your character slooowly crawling around the hospital, only to loose control again in movie-style sequences. You can skip it, but I higly recommend to sit through it, otherwise you´ll be even more confused when the first real mission starts. And as usual in Kojima´s games, you don´t have to wait long to meet very bizarre about a flying gas mask-child in a straight-jacket? A fire Elementar? A burning Blue Whale jumping out of the sea and swallowing a helicopter? You´ll get it all in the first hour! The graphics are simply brilliant. With a GTX 980ti things flow smoothly at the highest settings with astonishing effects, the details are amazing, it really is a beatiful game. If you need an excuse to buy yourself a new graphics card, here you have it (your probably gonna need it!). The battle controls, shooting and controlling vehicles, are quite sharp and well executed, though controlling weapons is more accurate than controlling your character moving around, it is not really up to par with the best 3rd-person games when you are to jump, hide, take cover and move sideways while using weapons. But once you get to grips with it, it works well. I downloaded it right when it was released, and as of 1st september the game states that 'servers are going through maintenance' and I have not yet gotten in to online mode, checking out the store and so on. Hope they´ll fix it soon. All in all, it is a beautiful game, and the freedom to roam around and taking on missions in different ways are a welcome change from earlier games in the series. It is a complex game and it will provide many hours of gameplay, that´s for sure.\n",

      "Original: TERRIBLE PORT. This is a good game, and i own and still occasionally play the Strangelight PC port i bought a decade back. It ran well on GeForce 6600 and a Pentium 4, it contained fitting music, there was nothing terribly wrong with it. I also play the Dreamcast original version, and i really think ancient that port was a success, well done. Both ran at about 50/60fps full speed pretty much throughout. The negatives of the Strangelight PC port were lack of widescreen support and lack of analog trigger support, and some gamepads will have deadzone issues in menus. but it was consistent with hardware available at the time, and it still runs great. This port however is terrible. The framerate is all over the place. regardless of resolution. Car shadows are missing randomly (lack of depth bias?), and the colour is less vibrant, i think specular highlight is too narrow, among other things. And the worst of all: CONTROL IS TERRIBLE. Even after recent patch introducing gamepad support, the analog stick is only mapped to keyboard control, making lane changing on purpose or waving between traffic nearly impossible. The keyboard support could have been done better too. The music has also been replaced, and badly. I understand that original music might have been no longer possible, but replacement music doesn't match the tempo or the mood of original. Crazy Taxi needs really fast paced music to feel right. Strangelight port also replaced music, but it fits better, more similar to original. Native widescren support in this port is OK, menu/overlay is stretched but 3D rendering is properly widescreen adjusted. I would have appreciated more effort with some overlays, but it's fine by me. But that's really the only good thing i could potentially say about this port.\n",

      "Original: This is what would happen if Evolve evolved into a good game and somebody was like 'can we add sharks?' just for good measure. Really fun game. Snagged it on sale for and have been pretty addicted ever since. It's a competitive 4v2 game where one group is a team of four divers, and the other is a team of two sharks. The divers must escort a robotic submersible that cracks safes around the map, collecting treasure and buying new weapons along the way. Once the robot cracks all the safes, he heads back up to the surface and the divers need to protect him during the ascent. The shark team's objective is a lot simpler: maul divers to death. For every kill, the sharks earn evolution points which can be spent on upgrading an active ability (each of the five species of shark has a unique active ability) or passive buffs. It's a simple game that works so well because of a solid foundation of good gameplay (both shark and diver gameplay are great), good map design, and great atmosphere. Playing as a diver and seeing a shark grab one of your friends and disappearing into the blue is straight-up terrifying. And playing as a shark lurking around trying to catch the divers unawares is just a blast. Recommended.\n",

      "Original: I love this game. It is fairly difficult to get the game to run on a lot of PC's, but once you get past that, it's a pretty good game. Here are a few of my tips to get the game to work: Download X live less (it's not spelled like that, but Steam blocks it all out if I write it with no spaces) to disable Games for Windows - LIVE. This way, you don't have to bother making an Xbox account, installing Games for Windows - LIVE, and you will actually be able to save your game. If Social Club is giving you a hard time, disable it. To do this, go to your Grand Theft Auto IV directory, and find the file Rename it to This will disable Social Club, so once you launch the game, it will automatically open the game, instead of bringing up the Social Club launcher. This is important if you're running on Windows 8 or Run Steam as Administator. Find the Steam application on your desktop, right click, go to Properties, Advanced, and check the box that says 'Run as administrator'. If you don't do this, you will get an error, preventing you from playing the game. Now with all that out of the way, let's talk more about the game! Grand Theft Auto IV is very fun. The missions can become rather repetetive, but for this reason, you may want to do some other things around the city, like hanging out with friends or girlfriends, going to strip clubs, just driving around or taking rides in taxis, going on massive murder sprees, or just taking breaks from the game. Something great about the game is that, kind of like games from Telltale, choices you make tailors how the game will go. I won't give out any spoilers, but let's just say, you should have a backup of your save just before the end of the game, because the ending choice you make makes a huge difference. Although, there is a point in most games where it just gets boring. Say you didn't buy the DLC, and the base game doesn't have the spark anymore. To have some more fun again, you can download mods! There are many great mods from the game. Some of my favorites are the 'First Person' mod, and the 'Traffic Load' mod, which gives traffic more variety, and stops the annoying taxi bug, which occurs when you mod other cars in. There are also graphical mods to make the game look amazing, even almost real, if your PC can handle it. Long story short, it's a very fun game, once you get it working. I would only recommend to buy this game when it goes on sale though, considering how much of a pain it is to get the game working, and that it's not for everyone. Then, if you can't get it working, you only spend a couple bucks, rather than 20. Have a good one, everyone! If you have any questions about the game not working, feel free to message me or comment on my profile. I can't make any guarantees to help you, but I will try.\n",

      "Original: Great game for kids and adults alike! No character actually dies in this game (unlike the movies), every scary part from the movies has a humourous twist on it, and the difficulty compared to the other lego games is pretty tame. Me and my daughter finished this in 33 hours, 100%. Marvel heroes same time played, 54%. Ever wanted to explore any of the jurassic parks? Complete open world for all movies, which is something that i really liked. You can play as dinos or any of the characters, even steven spielberg! Nice fast travel locations once you discover them, makes for a far less time consuming game compared to some other lego ones. Now the only downsides are there is still no multiplayer (online, steam friends) still just local coop. This is the one thing ive only wanted changed to the lego games! The other would be its got quite a few bugs. A couple areas i had to restart because of these, and one area i couldnt even get past until someone found a fix in the steam forums. Overall definately an awesome game. About an hour value untill game completion. **If you get stuck with the raptors, turn Vsnyc on. It fixes the gamebreaking bugs for them.\n",

      "Original: Haven't finished it yet, but i can already tell, that this will be an underrated gem of a game, with a great potential for expansion and/or sequel. To simply put it, this is Diablo on steroids, with guns, guts and giggly physics (not so sure about last one, but it sure sounded good). The shift in this Action/RPG is definetely in the Action category. RPG elements feel sorta gimmicky and don't add a lot to the overall game design (which is, for the most part, solid). Speaking of negative aspects of this game, the fatalities. While the idea of brutal finisher moves is fine by itself, it is certainly implemented wrong here. Instead of doing those fatalities fast, intuitive and varied they went with long, flow breaking and boring. To put it simply - they are long and there is not a lot of them, so they get old pretty quick. Interceptor, make them play faster, otherwise they are seriously messing with the flow of the game, to the point that i was ignoring fatalities on purpose. Other notable suggestions to the developers would be adding some kind of sound indication for your ammo dipleeding and a back key on the upgrade menu. Oh and also Russian text would be nice. I, personally, don't have problems with English, but i cannot suggest this game to a lot of my russian friends simply because there is no russian language in the game. And i know a lot of Russian gamers really want to play this game and witness it in its full glory. So yeah those are my humble suggestions so far, hopefully someone at interceptor will hear them.\n",

      "Original: Ah, yes. Counter Strike: Source, or just CSS, is quite the compassionatiour for the beloved series. This game is superior to all other Counter Strike games. Now, obviously, CSGO has a lot more content and additional things that make it a hit for the modern age of FPS's than CSS. However, I must point out that CSS is heavily more realistic and strategic than GO. Many reasons being that in GO, you survive better when you aren't near your allies. in CSS, this can apply too, but usually you're better off running around and making loud noises to attract the enemies to your position. This can lead to the defining point in a round where if it's just you as the last man standing versus the rest of the opposing force, you can easily win the round by sitting in a spot where the enemy wouldn't think to check, and when his buddies follow him, run and gun like crazy. This is a rather boring review, so I'll cut it short here and make the important thing about CSS as noticable as possible: It's not a full reskin of Counter-Strike. It is, however, a compelling and much more competitive addition to the series. This is an example of Counter Strike's finest times, since CSS was such a hit back then (and still is to some degree).

      "Original: Inside (just like Limbo) is a linear puzzle-platforming game. It's tight controls, stellar art style, atmosphere, ambiguous story, and straightforward level design will have you gripped from the beginning, up until the closing credits. Inside's gameplay strikes a nice balance between puzzles, set-pieces (which can be mini puzzles as well), and soaking in what is going on in this strange world, that a young boy is plunged into. The level design also has puzzles that you never need to go online to search for solutions, and you'll often never be too stuck on one puzzle, but they are clever enough to make you feel good when you have that 'a-hah!' moment. The art style makes this another game that will have timeless graphics. The art style sets the tone well, and the subtle details help build understanding of what is going on (and also lets you appreciate how much time was put into the big and small details the developers placed in). The perspective is done well, and helps make it a step above most other games that usually use some mediocre 2d background. This game unfortunately is very short (took me 4 hours to get all the achievements) and lacks much replay value outside the easy to obtain achievements.

' moment. the art style makes this another game that will have timeless graphics. the art style sets the tone well, and the subtle details help build understanding of what is going on ( and also lets you appreciate how much time was put into the big and small details the developers placed in ). the perspective is done well, and helps make it a step above most other games that usually use some mediocre 2d background. this game unfortunately is very short ( took me 4 hours to get all the achievements ) and lacks much replay value outside the easy\n",

      "Original: INSIDE is a queer, immersive, and beatiful game. It puts you in control of a young boy on the run, evading guards and getting around obstacles - but why? The game doesn't tell you anything about its grim world in text or dialogue, and it's up to the player to make their own interpretation based on what they see. Along the boy's journey you pass through various areas of this strange world - all of them gorgeous. The game is full of suprises up until the very end, and you never feel like it overstays its welcome. The gameplay itself may not be terribly challenging or, on a base level, new. You run to the right, hide from guards, and solve some puzzles that shouldn't take more than about a minute to figure out. Yet it still sets itself apart with how well done these simple mechanics are done. The animations of the main character feel very organic, and the way the game is set up you never feel like you're doing something you've already done before, nor do the puzzles ever feel out of place. The game takes around 3-4 hours to complete on your first run through, and aside from some hidden secrets there's no major incentive to replay it. However, the brief time it takes to play it is something you'd be hard pressed to find in any other games out there. If you're looking for a challenging platformer, this isn't the game you want. If you on the other hand want to immerse yourself in a unique experience, I couldn't recommend it enough.\n",

      "Original: I'm sure you've all heard about how great Limbo is and that it is a excellent example of video games as art. I can honestly say that those things are no ecsagetation. When I first played the game, it left a lasting impression that not a lot of games have done already. It's dark, depressing, and it makes you think about how far a person will go to protect the one he cares for. The game is a puzzle platformer, but it mostly relies on environmental puzzles. They are all set up so that you'll die a few times before you find the correct solution. You have unlimited lives, so don't be afraid to expirament. An interesting thing about the puzzles is that the character always dies a violent and often grusome death for every wrong move you make. This discourages the player from making the same mistake over and over again and believe me, you do not want to see the character mutilated a hundred times. The gameplay is smooth and simple. All your character really does is run, jump, climb, pull, push, and utilize certain objects. It's how you go about playing the game that counts. Some puzzles will take many tries to solve, but they become a bit easier once you figure them out. The art direction is hauntingly beautiful and the presentation looks like something out of a black and white horror cartoon. There's barely any music in the game, which adds to the unsettlty. The only problem I had with the game is the story. You have no idea what's going on, other than that you're a boy looking for his sister in a hellish world. Everything is told through gameplay and there nothing there to explain why you're here or why you're sister is missing. The ending is very confusing, and it's up to you to interpret the game's meaning. The story isn't really an issue for me, since the gameplay is all that matters. Overall, I would recommend Limbo to anyone who likes puzzles and platformers or someone who likes dark and creepy games. The gameplay is solid the puzzles are clever. The art is amazing and the sound is unnerving. The only downsides are the short length (you can beat the game in about 3 to 5 hours) and the confusing story, but other than that, a trip to Limbo is definatly worth it.\n",

      "Original: It's hard to put into words what I love about Inside. Even though it's a game all about its story and setting, I can't say much about it – not just because I don't want to spoil it, but because when I finished it I had no idea what on earth I'd just gone through. And I loved it. The story of this game is never told to you directly in any way whatsoever (not a single word is spoken in the whole game), but it's pulled off expertly so that it never feels like it's just made to be confusing. Instead, it makes you think and wonder and *want* to figure out what's going on. That really is half the fun of it. The rest of the fun comes from a blend of good puzzles, occasional high-adrenaline sections, incredible visuals, and sound design that really gets under your skin at times. The game is 4-5 hours long and not very replayable, however, so be prepared to be disappointed if you value your games by quantity of entertainment. From a quality point of view, though, it's absolutely worth it. This is a massive step up for Playdead. Limbo was a very memorable puzzle platformer with a unique style; Inside is art.\n",

      "Original: INSIDE is a game which integrates the platforming, adventure and puzzle aspects into a slickly animated package with beautiful art direction. There are no loading screens and transitions between areas are completely seamless. I can understand the comparisons to Limbo since you're once again playing a young boy, the puzzle mechanics are similar and the checkpoint system is the same. The difference here is that the environment lives and each element in the world is very realistic; as one would expect since the entire story is based on everything that you see / hear / observe in the environment as you progress. Note that the game does NOT have any dialogue at all (or hints for that matter). Personally, INSIDE reminds me of Deadlight - the early sections are similar; and Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) - beautiful art direction and short. As a reference, I finished my first playthrough in 5 hours and took another 1-2 hours to get all the achievements. Some of the puzzles are very clever but ALL of them are amazingly integrated and realistic too. At no point did I feel that a puzzle made no sense. The realism is uncanny as you will find that if you treat things in the game like game objects, the game will surprise you. I come away from INSIDE with the feeling that one would get after watching an interesting movie and wanting others to experience it themselves. Even after completing the game, it's still difficult to conclusively say whether it's a good or a bad game. What INSIDE is to me is interesting .\n",

      "Original: LIMBO is a very simple puzzle platformer with a unique, minimalist art style. I always love games with great atmosphere. If you are looking for a story, then this game won't do as it focuses more on gameplay. Controls are simple (I prefer to use a controller for this game) and easy to get used to. Puzzles can prove challenging sometimes (maybe because I tend to overthink them xP) but not too hard that you spend a lot of time to figure them out. It's all about trial and error with the puzzles.

      "Original: Review + first 10 min of gameplay here: Inside is the new game by Playdead, the creators of Limbo, a minimalist puzzle-platformer that I truly loved. For this reason when Inside was released I couldn’t wait to play it and clearly I had very high expectations. I can already tell you that my expectations have been exceeded. Inside is very similar to Limbo in many aspects but it’s simply better. Inside is platformer where you control a young boy in a dystopian world and all you have to do is to run and solve puzzles while trying to survive. Puzzles can be very simple like moving some boxes or levers but you will also find some that are more challenging. In one case I even had to google the solution. Beside that extreme case though, all puzzles can be solved pretty quickly with no frustration at all. Playdead doesn’t tell us much about the plot. There are no dialogues, instructions or guidelines during the game. All you know comes from the gameplay and even after finishing the game you will still have some doubts. I loved this approach as it gave me the opportunity to make my personal judgement on why that little faceless boy ended up in a story bigger than him. To avoid any spoilers I can only say that you are in a dark world where technology is used for evil purposes and people live enslaved and brain-dead. This creepy scenario is beautifully represented by minimalist and almost monochromatic graphics that creates a unique atmosphere of anxiety but it’s so marvellous and cinematic that will make you wow all the time. “Cinematic” is a key word as you really have the feeling of being in a movie; this is also due to the supreme usage of the camera. Often I just stopped playing to appreciate the beauty of my surroundings or of some animations. In that sense, it reminds me Another World, epic game from ‘80s. The sounds effects and music also stand out. I still remember the sound of my footsteps or of me jumping in the water and the music during a change of scene. I’ve played Inside during the night wearing my headset and I was totally dragged into that world. Inside is a great game but also a beautiful piece of art. I strongly recommend it to any type of gamer as it’s a gaming experience that you won’t forget. Things I liked the most: + The atmosphere, that feeling of worry after each step in this dystopian world + The graphics, minimalist but so detailed at the same time. Really a piece of art + The underwater levels. Especially the part of the submarine Things that could be improved: - Duration. It’s only 2-3 hours game. Not a big problem for me but I can understand that it could be too short for many gamers - Variety. I would have loved more outdoor levels Worth to buy it? - BUY IT AT FULL PRICE BUY IT DISCOUNTED DON’T BUY IT\n",

      "Original: This game is great! It took a little time to get into, but afterwards I really started to enjoy it. It isn't a long game, but it has a very nicely done story, challenging gameplay, fun battle system, and amazing artwork. The narrator does a great job throughout the game, and I can appreciate the hidden 'extras' that are integrated into the game. (Going on a spree of destroying the environment cues the narrator to say 'Kid just rages for a Below is my review for Bastion which I have given a 9/10. Story - The story is basically about an event that happened called 'The Calamity', and pits you in the role of a survivor trying to learn more about what happened, all the while restoring a grand ship called 'The Bastion' whose significance you don't learn about until later. The story is told through the narrator's narration of your actions as you work your way through the game. It is mainly a giant fetch quest, ('We need X of these to restore the Bastion'). But the allure of this game is that you have no idea what the story is at the beginning, and your only way of learning more is by completing levels to learn more from the narrator as you work through the level and eventually return from the mission. Gameplay - The overall gameplay is fun, fast paced, and challenging. The game was very well balanced and I really enjoyed it. The developers put a lot of work into this game to ensure an awesome experience and they did a wonderful job. Graphics - The graphics are amazing, hand-drawn and well-animated. There aren't too many spots in this action RPG where you can stop and enjoy the scenery but you have to stop occasionally and admire the gorgeous hand drawn graphics, and slick animations. You will also find that many portions of the environment are destructible, meaning you can attack walls and eventually fall off the level, or hide behind hedges which enemies will have to destroy to get to you. You are also occasionally treated with gorgeous still shots or character portraits. Battle System - The battle system in Bastion is very unique. This is an Action RPG with a unique variety of weapons that let you choose how you want to play. You can choose ranged weapons or melee weapons or many of the hybrid weapons in between. Some battles require strategy and some just ask you to destroy everything that moves. Additional Systems - There are also many additional systems in this game, you can craft upgrades for your weapons which add various bonuses or change the way the weapon works altogether. If you find the game to easy, you can also craft items that will make the enemies more powerful or handicap your character. Similarly, if you find the game too difficult, you can craft items that will provide passive bonuses to your character. You can also craft quest items that you can provide to the NPCs to hear tiny snippets that provide insight into the characters' past, or to flesh out parts of the overarching narrative. Audio - The music in this game is excellent, and some of the most memorable 'tunes' I've heard in a game in a long time. Shortly through the game you will unlock a jukebox of sorts that lets you replay various music which is the point when you realize how good the music really is. Replayability - The game is pretty linear throughout, but in the end, you are faced with two great choices which affect your final ending. I wouldn't say there is a lot of replayability once the story is over, unless you are a collectionist who wants every item, every upgrade, every skill, complete every level, etc. However, if you enjoyed the gameplay like me, that's your main attraction, and you don't care if you are trudging through the same story again. There is a New Game + function that lets you retain various perks and start a new game. Value - I definitely got my money's worth with this game. Although the story was pretty short, I had a lot of fun and I passed by a few collectables that would have stretched out the story a bit more. I also go Bastion on sale from the Steam Summer Sale which was nice, but after having played it I would have paid full price for this game, it is definitely worth it. Overall, I give Bastion a 9/10. It's an action packed adventure through a mysterious fantasy world that keeps you begging for more. Telling the story through the perspective of the narrator is a unique spin on the traditional outspoken action hero that makes the game feel fresh and different. The gorgeous artwork will leave you drooling and collectionists will enjoy the many extras this game has to offer. Get this one, you won't regret it. And let's all hope for a Bastion 2.\n",

You play “the kid”, a young boy who wakes up after a terrible accident that has shattered the world. The kid then tries to rebuild the world, by going from city to city and collecting the needed pieces. Gameplay-wise, Bastion is a dungeoncrawler where you fight your way through set levels and enemies. It’s simple and straightforward; Right click for one type of attack, left click for another. You can also collect potions to be able to perform a limited amount of special attacks. There is no inventory system, but you can switch through weapons when you return to your base, to where you return after each finished level. I found the gameplay quite easy and it was a casual and relaxing experience. However, the greatness of this game doesn’t lie in the combat system: It lies in the beautiful audio, graphics and storytelling. Bastion is a work of art. When you start the game, the first thing you will notice is the narrator. A sooth voice that tells the story about the kid as you are experiencing it. As you start walking, you will see the floor and walls being created around you as you move forward. And finally, the soundtrack is gorgeous. I am listening to it now, weeks after I finished the game. The game has a good length – I finished in around 8 hours all in all.

      "Original: -Quick review- Bastion is a good game, has excellent music, plays like a dungeon crawler, and has a great story that you can complete in maybe 5-6 hours. -l5dS0A -Detailed breakdown review- Story: you play as one character known simply as “the kid”, the kid is trying to collect shards to bring back the Bastion. The Bastion was a place everyone agreed to meet if there was an emergency. Through great story telling, a great narrator and many twists and turns in this puzzle-piece-world you find yourself sitting back and enjoying a story being told with some good natured humor as well. Music: The game has extraordinarily good music, a video game itself needs to have good music, or else it takes away from the experience, but bastion has very suitable music and a soundtrack that I personally wouldn’t mind downloading. Play-Style: You can swing a hammer, shoot a bow, poke with a stick, go click-happy with double revolver pistols and many other choices of weapons and combinations. Pick your favorite weapons; upgrade them at the forge to make yourself into one lethal mean killing machine. Achievements: I tend to play video games like I’m in a race to complete them, so I have played through the game’s story about 4 times now gathering achievements. In addition to playing through that many times, it took me only 21 hours. (Such as 02/12/14) The achievements themselves aren’t overwhelmingly challenging, which is good sometimes you just want a relaxing game, if you’re going for a 100% completed game, this one is very doable, look up the guides for the harder achievements, and prepare yourself for a some-what challenging experience Price: I consider price by how much time I’ve put into a game, how enjoyable it was, and if it’s replayable. Full price for Bastion is at this time. I would suggest waiting for a 50% or 75% sale before purchasing. But I would highly recommend this game to anyone who’s looking for something new to play. ------Edits and updates------ Edit/Update May 27, 2016: added link to my new/updated Bastion YouTube Review.\n",
      "Split: - quick review - bastion is a good game, has excellent music, plays like a dungeon crawler, and has a great story that you can complete in maybe 5 - 6 hours. - l5ds0a - detailed breakdown review - story : you play as one character known simply as “ the kid ”, the kid is trying to collect shards to bring back the bastion. the bastion was a place everyone agreed to meet if there was an emergency. through great story telling, a great narrator and many twists and turns in this puzzle - piece - world you find yourself sitting back and enjoying a story being told with some good natured humor as well. music : the game has extraordinarily good music, a video game itself needs to have good music, or else it takes away from the experience, but bastion has very suitable music and a soundtrack that i personally wouldn ’ t mind downloading. play - style : you can swing a hammer, shoot a bow, poke with a stick, go click - happy with double revolver pistols and many other choices of weapons and combinations. pick your favorite weapons ; upgrade them at the forge to make yourself into one lethal mean killing machine. achievements : i tend to play video games like i ’ m in a race to complete\n",

      "Original: Bastion is an odd game, kind of dreamy, and both melancholy and pragmatic. It feels like a simple game, but the hints dropped by the narrator give warning long before the player truly begins to discover what it's about. The art style is very attractive and the UI is easy to understand. It's not too long, but levels can become addicting and there's definitely replay value both in learning the full story and in the New Game +1 option. The music is fantastic and I'll definitely be acquiring the soundtrack soon. (Also, the music and the narrator both remind me of Firefly, and Zulf and Zia are both cute. All the characters are cute. Did I mention the great art style?) The combat can be picked up pretty quickly, but mastering it - and the challenges for each weapon - are much harder. I'd definitely recommend playing this game if you're looking for an unusual and creative experience.\n",

      "Original: Awesome that this game came to steam, huge influx of players which makes the games a ton funner and faster. i instant Queue now at non-peak hours where before steam-integration it may have taken a minute. one of the best sim games in the steam library, nothing can compare to the tactical play of a co-ordinated lance of four. having some mech's rock anti-missile systems to protect you and nearby team and lance members while another mech runs ECM's and UAV's, the team play is massive. the game can get pretty deep. the game looks beautiful and every mech has it's own personal cockpit, the more you use your mech's the more you master them, giving you small boosts mech turn speed) and you can customize all the internals, even more so with 'clan mechs', including your engine size/model, how many heatsinks you install, your weapon platforms, your ammo storage depending on platforms, your Anti-missile-system what kind of metal your mech is contructed of, there's too much to say. when you finally take the time to custom-mod your mech you really feel like it's 'your' mech because you tuned it the way you want to play it. Pay-2-win? there are microtransactions in the game, but they are mostly for appearance (items that can be placed in the cockpit though you can buy mech's with real cash, you can earn mech platform's (except for 'hero mechs') with in-game cash won by using trial/loaner mechs for a while when you begin, very similar to league of legends. the trial mechs are built well so you wont be underperforming as well. if you are a fan of sim-warfare games, dont miss this one.\n",

      "Original: It's definitely pay2win but it's more forgiving than other f2p games cause you can have roles. It's okay to use a trial (good) mech and jump in with friends. And you can perform better than others in better mechs by playing your role and staying in a group. However, if you want to choose this game and be serious about it, I don't recommend it. It's a serious serious grind. Tons upon tons of items to buy. And the inventory/management has to be one of the most confusing I've ever seen. The only reason I can survive is cause my friend who has spent $1200 ingame manages stuff for me. There's 4 different kids of currency: C-bills, mech XP and general XP and MC. Yes it's that confusing. To use one you must convert another, which requires MC in order to convert as a conversion fee. Confusing as all hell. And all the mechs they release are just restated old mechs, and they charge like $40 per mech. In order to 'upgrade' your mech/pilot trees, you must actually buy 2 other variants of that mech. This means a casual player like me who just wants to play one type of mech/playstyle is forced to buy other mechs to fully upgrade the mech I want to main. Again, it's another obvious f2p mechanic. If you can get past this, then it's a fun game. Has that CS:GO feel but u survive longer and thus can have more fun.\n",

      "Original: I have played this game since closed beta, and a Legendary Founder for the game. I have seen this game change very much since those days. Ever since IGP went bankrupt and the license has been under PGI control, they have done a lot to make the game so much more. From Faction Warfare, to a robust tutorial system, to a future PVE campaign. This game is not Call of Duty, this is not Rambo rampage, this is MechWarrior. The combat is slower paced, and team oriented. Running around solo, trying to be superman will get you killed. Stick with your team, focus fire, provide cover fire and try to move from cover to cover. Don't be scared by the price of mechs and mech packs, every single mech (except for hero mechs) can be earned for free by simply playing the game and grinding cbills. There is no 'Pay to Win' mech, buying mechs with cash does not give you a mech thats superior to a standard mech bought with cbills. The only difference between a standard mechs, champion and Hero mechs is that champion mechs earn 30% mroe xp (that stacks with premium time), and Hero mechs {designated by parenthesis like (F), (L), (I), (S), etc} earn 30% more cbills (which stacks with premium time). But you can get standard versions of the same mechs without the bonuses. Not to mention that almost every month PGI has an event where you can usually earn free cbills, MC, mech bays and sometimes even mechs for free. And you can earn free mech bays for doing faction warfare. [Warning if you are a brand new player, I do not recommend doing faction warfare until you have 4 full mechs that are decently skilled) This game will give back to you what you put back into, whether its just a couple quick drops for after hard day, or you are binge-playing over the weekend to get event rewards, The more you play, the better your understanding of the maps and mechs will do you will. Torso twisting, focus firing, cover from LRM swarms, This game will take time to get good at, and putting skills into mechs will make your mechs play better, which will in turn make you play better. Dont be afraid to ask for help, the community thats been here for over 3 years has no problem helping out new players, but for more indepth answers to your questions, go to the MWO forums. There is only so much people can answer in the games chat.\n",

      "Original: In rough terms, MWO is Team Fortress crossed with Arma with giant robots. There are 4 classes of mechs, light, medium, heavy, and assault. Light mechs have little armor and are like the annoying, nimble spy. Mediums and heavies are slower, have more armor and weapons, and are like the soldier. Assaults are slow, lumbering, and hightly armed like the Heavy. Basically the slower a mech moves the more armor and weapons it can have. It plays like Arma. It's highly beneficial to move as a team and use tactics. Unless you're playing a light mech its hard to bunny hop your way out of trouble, so you must be decisive and deliberate. Mechs (other than lights) move at a slower pace than most FPS games, but I wouldn't say the game play is dull or slow. When you're in a brawl it is intense. The progression system is grindy. To increase a mechs power you have to level up 3 variant mechs of the same chassis to master it. Then you have level up 6 more to unlock elite skills. Now you have mastered one weight class of mech and have to level up 27 more mechs. The problem is you probably don't want most of these mechs so it becomes a chore. The payment model of the game is likely responsible for some of the lack of fun in the progression system. It should have been either a flat purchase of $60 or charge a monthly access fee. They could learn a lot from Blizzard games like Diablo III or Heroes of the Storm. There is also a purchasable in-game currency called MC which is anti-consumer because you always have to buy more of it than what you need and it obfuscates what things actually cost. The game is stable and I don't have crash, lag, or connection issues. The graphics are getting dated. The game needs an update to make the mechs and environments more detailed and brighter. Mechs don't feel large. The MSAA in the game is very taxing even on my NVidia 780. I just barely get 60fps when MSAA is enabled. Despite my gripes, the game is a lot of fun. I recommend it with the caveat that you need to be willing to spend money on premium time to reduce the grind. I couldn't imagine playing it without the 50% C-Bill/XP bonus. Progression would be unacceptably slow.\n",

      "Original: 'The Thinking Man's FPS' TL;DR Big mechs shoot each other in a rich setting and beautiful maps with a focus on tactics and customization and teamwork. I've heard this game called that from the community as I've played and I must say it is very accurate. There is a LOT going on in a typical match for MWO. Constantly knowing where my allies are moving, keeping an eye on the Assaults (the slow behemoths) to make sure we don't leave them behind, scanning the targets that the lights (the small speedy ones) are scouting, and always monitoring heat while being under fire by the enemy team. It is exhilarating! Mechwarrior Online is set in the Battletech universe that has a ton of history and lore to back up the mechs in the game. While this game is less canon and more action, it is a still a great place for lovers of the setting to get their fix. The lore is unimportant to gameplay, so there is nothing stopping a complete newcomer to the game to feel left out. This is a game about tactics. You choose your mech from a starting roster of trial mechs after a tutorial that just BARELY gets you ready to dive into the deep ocean that is MWO. There are four 'weight' classes: Light, Medium, Heavy, and Assault. Upon first look, it appears to be a rock, paper, scissors type of scenario, but that is entirely not the case. This game offers a ton of customization to certain mechs (which are available in two separate 'makes' that are similar to factions) so that your assault can run with the heavies, or allow your light to carry more firepower than some Heavy mechs. It can be tough to pick a mech in the start and there is no right or wrong mech, but after a good game and some quick deaths, one quickly learns the pros and cons of each class. As I mentioned before, there are two 'factions' that really only shine in the Community Warfare gamemode, which puts the player in a mercenary position accepting contracts from one of the separate factions in the game. Otherwise, a mech's faction has no real difference besides the level of customization. Mechs can be outfitted with weapons based on the 'hardpoints' found on the frame. For instance, an arm could allow three energy weapons while the right torso could allow a ballistic and a missile. Mechs must be build around what is allowed by the hardpoints and weight limit while keeping survivability in the amount of armor and heat management that the build will allow. The Inner Spere mechs (IS) are special in that they allow one to customize engines, jump jets, and a host of weapon customizations. However, the IS mechs have special 'quirks' that allow them to really shine with a certain weapon type that should be taken into consideration. This allows the IS mechs to be specialized to a certain blend of combat and makes for each mech to be slightly different from another mech of the same build but on a different frame. The Clan mechs are a different beast entirely. While the IS mechs can change engines and loadouts, the Clan mechs cannot change the default engines or jumpjets in their mechs. They do allow one to swap out pieces called omnipods that change the hardpoints on a certain piece of the mech to allow for greater variety in weapon loadouts. This game has a great community with a nice dry humor while at the same time being very competitive. From my time with this game, salt and toxicity has always been rare, something that I contribute to the personality that is drawn to the lore and gameplay. Being a free game, there is an incentive to buy mechs with cash to gain early access, but every mech in the game has a variant that can be purchased with in game currencies. There are also 'hero' and 'champion' variants to most mechs that give a boost to mech xp or in game currency rates, but they don't feel necessary. If you enjoy the game, the grind will be something you enjoy and not a burden. The only cash item that is 'mandatory' or addition mech bays that allow you to own additional mechs. These are occasionally given away during events, but mostly will need to be purchased. In the end, I recommend this game to anyone who considers the RTS style games enjoyable and to anyone familiar with Battletech in general. It is a fun game and a great way to spend an evening.\n",

      "Original: I can recommend this game if you meet these two reasons: 1. You love Battletech. 2. You don't mind a Free to Play setup for your Battletech game. (Free to Play being Pay to Win) Now with that being said I downloaded this for free realizing it was Free to Play from the description. No harm there since I want to look things over. I tried it out and the test range tutorals and it feels like a mix between Mechwarrior 2, 3, and 4. The mechs handle nicely and the graphics are very nice during game play. The interface for creating custom mechs is there but it's somewhat limited to the hard point concept setup I'm guessing in started in Mechwarrior 4. That's the first time I remember seeing something like that which limited choices on mech/omni-mech designs. I hate that part of the game since I used to be a big time pen and papper battletech player and loved creating mech designs just to try out. So in that respect the game is limiting for me and puts a dampener on my interest in playing. The other aspect that contributes to this is the Free to Play model limitations. Personally I wish this wasn't an MMO Free to Play setup. The game is good but I think it would have been better if it were more like the Mechwarrior series before it in that there's a single player campaign but with a more robust multiplayer setup. This is basically a big cash grab using Battletech. Nice if you have the cash to blow on it but not so much if you want more then just that. Update 01/14/2016 - I put some time in to this and some money. The barrier for entry in to this game is dependant by the choice of grinding out tons of C-Bills for mech and equipment purchases which is perfectly fine. The other aspect is the fast track to buying mechs with real money. That being said the prices for some of those add-ons is really high when you look at the mech bundles. In game mech purchases provide a wide variety of choices but there are some limited to the Pay to Play credits or Mech Credits which you buy for real cash. Also expanding your garage for more mechs requires you to put real cash in which seems fine to me really for a pay to play system as well as the certain mechs requiring paying cash to get. A big downer I've had playing however is that in order to get better mastery of a mech you like you must purchase other variants of that mech and pilot those. So basically to level up your favorite mech you have to pilot other mechs to unlock the higher progression trees. I think that stinks in that if you are going to master something you don't practice with something else to master it. I feel this was put in to push people towards paying to buy mechs more frequently. The game itself isn't fun when you have to pilot something else to level and play the one mech you enjoy most. There is an instant messaging system in the game for when you aren't in matches so don't expect to find many social areas in the game itself like chat rooms or something. I've yet to find them myself in there. Really it's like paying WoW's BG system with Battletech and not having any place to socialize afterwards. I'm guessing you are limited to game forums and steam forums for that. Final thoughts: Don't spend any money till after your first 25 bonus matches are completed. Stick with the trial mechs and use them to get your initial C-Bill boost. It'll go a long way to saving up for a mech you find fun to pilot unless the trial mech is a Mech Credit only mech where you have to pay real money for.\n",
