      "Take one part Faerie Solitaire and two parts Puzzle Quest and mix in a little Poker or Yahtzee for good measure and you will get something like Runespell: Overture. You're a changeling of some sort and you fight monsters and take quests in exchange for coin and buffs (which come in the form of power-up cards). There's a story but it's not the strongest element in the game. Like the Puzzle Quest games, your battles are determined by playing a mini-game. Instead of match-3 though, the game is a card game similar to poker in which making certain combinations of cards (pairs, 5 of a kind, full house, flush, straight) will do a certain amount of damage to your opponent, who is trying to do the same to you. The ability to steal some cards from your opponent, plus the limited number of moves you get per turn to move cards or play power-ups adds just enough strategy to the game to keep it interesting. Admittedly, the game can get a bit repetitive after a while and I found the dialogue options to be a bit tedious but fortunately the game allows you to skip them if you want. It's an easy game to learn, and it's an entertaining casual game to play. It seems to be pretty short and the achievements don't seem too difficult to collect if that's your thing. Finding little gems like this is the reason I buy bundles.\n"

       " 37: [\"when i played braid in 2008, i didn ' t pay attention to one puzzle and finished the game using a walkthrough. since then, i have matured as a gamer and i decided to revisit braid. to my surprise, i began to complete puzzles without looking at walkthrough and by the end i completed the game completely without looking at a guide, except for one puzzle. everyone knows what braid is ; it is famous for being pretentious, but thoughtful, confusing and difficult, enigmatic, but engaging. all of these adjectives could be valid, and i agree with some of them, but not all of them. then, really it is up to you to make out what this game really is to you. at its core, it ' s a puzzle game. what i enjoy about the puzzles is that they don ' t require precision or finding specific objects to open other objects so that you can move forward, but instead require you to logically understand the mechanics in front of you. each world has a few levels and each level have a few puzzles in them. there is a symbiosis between each puzzle in each level, meaning that if you understand what happens on the first puzzle then the next puzzle just adds\",\n",
       "  'ever play super mario and die to a single goomba and lose a precious life? ever wanted to rewind time so you could try again? what if there was a game that revolved souly around that? this is braid, the awesome 2d platformer puzzle that will literally allow you to rewind your gameplay. play as tim as you quest to see the fairest madien in the land ( see my mario reference ), solving puzzles with the ability to travel backwards in time to redo your mistakes. the game has an interesting art style and a great concept. any super mario or puzzle game fans have to pick this up!',\n",
       "  'braid is a puzzle / platformer masterpiece, delivering a unique experience. gameplay mechanics are about manipulating time, to go through difficult but rewarding puzzles. art style is really beautiful. the storyline is interesting and the ending is great. however, there is not much replay value.',\n",
       "  \"puzzle platformers tend to be platform games with a few easy puzzles. braid is a puzzle games with some easy platform elements. the puzzle mechanic is one of the most innovative i have seen. it involves time manipulation and challenges you to think in new ways to predict the consequences of manipulating time in various ways and use this ability to achieve your goals. it starts out easy and the difficulty ramps up at a good pace. towards the end the game is challenging even for experienced puzzle solvers. the game is also non - linear in that you don ' t need to solve everything in one part of the game to progress to later parts, if you get stuck on a puzzle you can go somewhere else and come back to tackle that puzzle later. the game has an artistic style that feels completely natural and fits well with the unique style of the gameplay. graphics and sound contribute further to make the game atmospheric. the story is told in various ways, including texts you can read at the start of each level but also, in a way, through the pictures that you need to assemble to complete a level. all in all this is the best puzzle platformer i have played ( unless you count portal as a 3d puzzle platformer ) and highly recommended to anyone who likes puzzle games.\",\n",
       "  \"braid is a platformer puzzle game. you play as a man called tim as he traverses across various worlds to find his ' princess '. the game uses the concept of bending time to create platforming paths for the players to collect pieces puzzles throughout the different worlds. each world has a certain theme or a mechanic around which the puzzle is designed. the puzzles are very well made and will surely itch parts of your brain which may have gone untouched for far too long. that is not all what braid is all about. underneath this gameplay, braid tells a story. players can solve the different worlds and their puzzles in order to piece them together to fit an overall picture of what happened between tim and the princess. i don ' t want to spoil the ending, however i just want to say it will surely turn some heads. braid is a perfect example on how gameplay can act as a powerful storytelling device which other media simply cannot replicate.\",\n",
       "  \"on the surface, braid is a simple puzzle platformer. the gameplay, at its most basic level, consists of jumping on platforms and collecting puzzle pieces before moving to the next world. a couple of things set braid apart and make it a fantastic experience. the first is the visuals. everything in braid is hand drawn, and it ' s quite a pleasure to progress through the game and see the different landscapes. second ; the puzzles. the puzzles in the latter stages of the game are, to say the least, mind - bending. you will have difficulty getting through braid without a walkthrough for at least a couple of levels. braid is best played in short burts ; play for too long and the harder puzzles get frustrating. the puzzles themselves are brilliantly designed and are very satisfying to solve. the main gimmick of braid is the ability to manipulate ( reverse ) time. it adds another dimension to puzzle solving and forces you to think about puzzles in abstract ways. truthfully, braid isn ' t for everyone, but it offers a unique gameplay experience for the puzzler fan.\",\n",
       "  'a good inde puzzle game. not up there with braid, but i had fun with it.',\n",
       "  'default, the player can rewind time in each world, but each world has its own special mechanics that also deal with time. the player has to solve puzzles using this time mechanic, often with some precision platforming. each of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, but the levels are designed such that the player can walk past a puzzle to solve it later. some of the level designs are repeated in this game, but with new twists to be used with a new time based mechanic. the time based mechanics of braid are amazing for solving the tricky puzzles while also being cool yet confusing when thinking about how some of the mechanics work. although some of the puzzles can be a pain to figure out or time well with precise actions, braid tends to be a short game at 5 hours, and maybe more if players are really stuck on some puzzles. braid has its strong and unique puzzle gameplay while having good design and a story to think about. while the puzzles may be hard at times and the story a bit strange, this is a great indie title to check out and play for the different things it brings in the game.',\n",

       "  \"braid is a puzzle platformer. you play as tim, a guy attempting to rescue his princess from a monster. you explore 6 worlds, each with several levels filled with puzzles. you solve puzzles using a time manipulation mechanics, which are enhanced the further you go in the game. levels also feature hidden collectibles which unlock more of the story. the puzzles are clever and really engaging. it is so fulfilling when you finally figure out what it is you need to do. i think that the puzzles are made to be engaging but not so obscure that you will never work out the answer without that is my opinion. the levels themselves look so beautiful and have actually spent time just waltzing through the levels alone and admiring the art and music. the game seems to draw on many aspects of gaming and comes into its own when you look at the game and its plot from a philosophical standpoint. it really makes you think and encourages you to do so. replayability is limited with the beautiful art and music. once you complete the levels, find the hidden collctibles and see the ending, there isn ' t much to keep doing. the time trials extend replayability slightly, but not everyone likes time trials. despite this, i still think this is a game worth\"],\n",

' while this is a nice idea for immersive learning, and it ' s fairly well put together, it ' s really not the ' language learning game ' that it advertises as, because language learning is about so much more than vocabulary. put it this way : in the spanish version, it ' s optional whether or not to include noun genders. you can ' t learn spanish without knowing the gender system. so it doesn ' t teach you the language. it teaches you some words. that ' s it. get duolingo if you are a beginner. it ' s free and a million times better.\",\n",

      "Original: Color Symphoney. Really I don't have to say anything more than, 'It's free' to warrant a recommendation. This puzzle/platformer has an interesting mechanic, that of switching certain colors off, but there is a lot more to it then that. Atmosphere: The ffirst thing you notice when you start up this game is the loud, obnoxious music and sound effects. They are absolutely rancid, adding nothing to the playing experience, and forcing me to play the game on mute. Graphics wise, this game is dingey and very low-res, not much better than a flashgame. While this makes sense for a free game, it truly degrades the experience. 1/10 Storyline: Unlike most free games, the storyline, while difficult to follow, is somewhat enticing. It's not too complex, and it doesn't impact gameplay, but it is a nice feature to have. 5/10 Gameplay: This free game has a surprisingly long series of puzzles, and they are all very differant. While this game quicly fluxuates from too-damn-easy to rage-quit-hard quickly, the intersting mechanics make up for this. This game is a little bit misguiding, though, as there is no way to fight the monsters, you must instead turn them invisible to get by them. This gameplay would do well to be implemented in a game with better atmosphere and a higher budget 7/10 Replayability: While this game is a substantial size, there is no replayability. With no acheivements, there is no reason to revisit this game once you have completed the storyline. 2/10 All in all, this game is just barely worth the download time. You should enjoy themechanics of the game, but quickley realise that this game is just not up to par with any paid platformers.\n",

      "Original: The Binding of Isaac: Story: You are a naked kid, shooting scary creatures with your tears in the basement and you somehow enter a cave and venture through into your house to kill your mama and then slide up her va-jay-jay to kill her heart for the sake of revenge. Best. Story. Ever. Serious Review: Note: Don't let my playtime fool you. I have maybe twice or maybe even three times as much hours since Steam doesn't track offline hours Personal Score: 88/100 The Binding of Isaac is a Rogue-Like game, meaning every single level is randomly generated, along with the items. There is over 100 items and trinkets to unlock and use, so each time you play the game will be different. The game starts off really hard at first but it is easy to get the hang of. This game is a steal for (plus with DLC) and is a good buy for its price and when it is on sale, it will easily go to a dollar, but it is still worth it to buy the game full price nonetheless. In Addition, if you buy the expansion DLC, you get access to new characters, new floors (or maps, if you want to call it that), enemies, etc, but I don't recommend buying this until you get the hang of the game. Also, if you want to save your money, a remake for this game is coming out in the near future, with all these features plus even newer characters and items and stages, so if you want, you can buy that instead when it comes out. Pros: - There is a lot of replayability value - 6 characters to unlock (with DLC), each with their own benefit and flaws, over 100 items and 'trinkets' - Won't lag as much as this game is made in flash - The game itself is based off of Legend of Zelda, so if you have played those games, some of the mechanicswill be slightly the same Cons: -Really hard starting off -Achievements are hard to get sometimes -There is going to be a remake to this game so after that releasesss, this game will lack in substance -Some runs in game can end up super underpowering or overpowering -Rage Mode is induced in later levels -You will have no life the point you bought this game -Mommy has a stinky va-jay-jay -French Fries are too delicious for words\n",

I did not read the description with enough attention before I bought it and started playing it. I disliked this game a lot within the first twenty minutes of starting it because I thought I was going to play a smooth puzzle platformer with cool tricks up its sleeve. This game is quite far from what I expected it to be. The characters move in a slow and deliberate manner. Adding to my dislike of the game, I found the characters annoying, what with their slow movements and repeatedly saying 'I HAE-CHEW' (I hate you) and 'I LOOOOVE YOU!' I quickly wrote it off as a bad purchase and a bad game. I came back to it a few weeks later. This time I knew what I was getting myself into (a puzzle game, not a puzzle platformer) and I had a lot of fun solving its puzzles. It's interesting how changing ones perspective of what to expect changes other things as well. I stopped finding the characters annoying when I looked at this as a puzzle game. As a puzzle game with no level editor, it has almost no replayability. It's also a short game if you are good with solving puzzles. About Love, Hate and the Other Ones is full of great puzzles though. I recommend this game because I enjoyed it.\n",

      "Original: Game: Limbo Developer and publisher: Playdead Released: 3 August, 2011 Genre: Side-Scrolling Platformer Puzzler Setting: Limbo Spoiler-free plot summary: 'Uncertain of his sister's fate, a boy enters Limbo'. Full review: Limbo is a very simple puzzle game in a few ways; simple story premise, simple art style, and simple environments. The 'puzzles' oh Many praise Limbo for its very simplistic art-style, which, considering where Limbo is set, is very suitable. It's also easy on the eyes, and doesn't distract from playing the game. However, what they don't tell you is that the puzzles are excruciatingly hard. And I say 'puzzles' when in fact 3/4 of them are time-based events, which, if you're NANOSECONDS off, you'll fail and die and have to retry the puzzle over and over and over again until RNGesus bestows luck on your reflexes. Another puzzle actually requires you to discover a secret area quite a while before it too, so you'd never be able to solve the puzzle if you never thought of backtracking or didn't expect to explore in a non-exploring, linear game. After you beat the game and have collected all ten secret eggs, a secret level unlocks, and if you're deaf or hard of hearing like I am, then you can wave good-bye to your chances of unlocking all achievements, because the secret level requires good hearing and guess work because 95% of the level is pitch black! Luckily for me I eventually found a pattern in one area I had trouble with and ran on through without dying for the seventh time. Do I recommend buying Limbo? Hell no (no pun intended). Limbo has got to be one of the worst experiences with a video-game I've ever had, along with Daikatana, Deus Ex: Invisible War, Duke Nukem Forever, and Portal Stories: Mel .

      "Original: TL;DR You're better off if you just watch a walkthrough of this game really. It is the same guy who made The Stanley Parable, how could this game be a disappointment?! Well it actually is a bit disappointing, regardless of its creator. Now, there's literally almost NOTHING to talk about this game, because, for short, it is just a 'walking simulator' as The Stanley Parable, but the main difference between this game and that one, is pretty much that little gameplay present in SP which is totally ABSENT in this game. The plot is actually pretty nice, but i'm not going to spoil anything because if you already know the plot of this game there's literally no reason for you to buy it in the first place; let's just say that you're a player who plays someone else's games, with a narrator in the background. this is where the game falls off pretty quickly. Unlike SP, where you are given a story which you can shape and remodel as you make several choices, you're left here with a really linear storyline you can't interact at all with. This game is basically like this: 'Here's the story, walk to the end and remember to solve a few puzzles while you're at it' This game is so OBSESSED with its unique and only story that you can actually explore a bit the surroundings of some maps, only to be told by the narrator itself that basically 'doing X won't take you to Y' several times, as if it had been done just to mock off everyone who was waiting for a game akin to SP (!). So yeah, this is a BAD game with a GOOD plot, that fails where The Stanley Parable succeeded: creating a game whose main focus was the story while still retaining some bit of entertainment and/or extra stuff and such to make you actually WANT to play the game even with its lack of proper gameplay. In The Stanley Parable, you get to hear very hilarious humour as you make the story itself yours, familiarize with the only other character in the game and still find the usual morale at the end; In The Beginner's Guide, all you get is jogging time with an obnoxious narrator that actually laughs at your (pitiful) attempts at finding something to make the game gamey. And just for the record, one could think that comparing this game to The Stanley Parable might not be a good idea, but then again, this game would still be just a walking simulator with a story that either gets to you or bores you to death while you can't find anything else to entertain yourself with in there. 5/10\n",

      "Original: I found this interactive novel to be quite enjoyable. I was a big fan of pick-your-adventure books when I was young, and interactive novels I have always enjoyed. Fate/Stay Night was a particularly good one from Japan, but there are a lot of graphics since they like to make their novels into anime. Here, instead we have no graphics, no sound effects. Just the power of words well written. I like how you could choose how certain characters reacted to you with different personas. The MeChip butler, diva or caretaker all gave a different feel for the game, for example. For those looking for 27 endings of different plots, you'll have no fun with this novel. It's not really a game, more like a novel that you can immerse yourself in more deeply than a regular book because you get to add a bit of your own personality to the characters. I really became attached to the character in this story, and I've since bought the sequel, Heroes Rise: The Hero Project, and read that one through multiple times as well, I am looking forward to the final installment of the trilogy. I've stated before in my reviews, that I base a lot of it on how much a product costs me to play for the time I invest in it. At under I've easily gotten my money's worth, and with it on special til June 24th at it's hard to go wrong for something that you'll spend a few hours at a minimum reading. It's hard to find a paperback in a used bookstore for that price. Anyways, for what it claims to be, an interactive novel with memorable characters, it was a great investment for me. I hope you purchase the novel and agree.\n",

I think they may have added in a few extra scenes in each route to flesh each one out a little, and the stuff that comes with the Collector's Edition is a neat little bonus.

You will have to get used the voice if don't like it as it is a main part of the game. The narrator gives you alot of info to help paint the picture of what the world was like before. The art and music are great. The art is a bit steampunkish. The gameplay is great but seems much better with a a controller than the keyboard and mouse. The player has a few weapons to chose from but can only carry 2 at time. Each are very different to each other. There's no clear best weapon as it depends on your play style. For example their are fast attacking weapons that don't much at first but with upgrades are very useful. The game has a new game plus and a score attack mode that both unlocks after finishing the game once which add replayability. There is three arena in the main game but they are completely optional. If you feel like the game is easy there are options to making the enemies harder that can be unlocked early in the game. This is a must a buy game and you will get your money's worth.\n",

      "Original: I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #57 - Enemy Mind I cracked a smile right off the bat as I started playing Enemy Mind as it reminded me of playing Gradius on the NES. It's got the same side-scroller point of view, and the pixel art style has a similar feel to it as well. I really enjoyed the sound effects as well, they mostly sounded like something you'd hear on an 8 bit machine, mixed with some sounds that I swear sounded like they came right from an Atari 2600. But what's most interesting about Enemy Mind is the twist it adds to the typical shooter. You've probably gotten use to the whole shoot enemies, dodge bullets, and pick up powerups that give you new weapons or other abilities. In Enemy Mind, you don't pick up powerups, but instead you take over other ships, inheriting their abilities instead. You basically have 2 weapons. One is your offensive weapon, which varies based on what ship you are currently in. The other is your psychic beam, or whatever you want to call it, that when it comes in contact with another ship, you take it over. If the beam misses, then it just boomerangs back to you. This changes up the gameplay because each ship has a limited amount of hull and ammo. So you can only take a couple of hits (varying based on what ship you are in), and you have a limited number of shots. So you're forced to continually bounce between different ships in order to stay alive. Each ship type has a different weapon, and some of these are exactly what you'd expect in a shooter, varying from your average straight shooting bullets to lasers, to triple-fire shots. But other ships add some unusual variety, such as the ship that launches itself forward like a missle. You can even take over asteroids which don't have any offensive capability, but basically just house your consciousness until you can project yourself into something else. The game is broken up into multiple levels, with each level being broken up into multiple stages, with the final stage being a boss battle. If you die then you start over at the beginning of the stage you died on. You do have a limited number of lives, but you can continue when the game is over. Also once you progress past a level then anytime you start a new game you can skip levels you have already beaten. I played with a gamepad, and didn't have any issues with the controls at all. I also like the fact that it supports a second local player, but I didn't actually try it out with a second person. I had fun with the game, but it also doesn't look like something that I would play for hours on end. It seems more like the kind of game where I will get through all of the levels and beat the game, and move on to something else. It's fun and all, but for me not necessarily a lot of replayability. So with that in mind, you might be a bit wary of the price if you don't think it's something you'll spend a lot of time with. This might be a better game to pick up on sale or in a bundle. But, unlike many shooters I've played, I genuinely feel like Enemy Mind has added something new to the genre and isn't just another generic shooter. Between it's uniqueness and the well done implementation, this is certainly a game I can recommend checking out.\n",

      "Original: Wow, this is a little gem. I've seen it floating around on Steam since it came out, but I never really looked into it too closely. I'm not sure what I thought it was, but I wasn't expecting it to be so good. It's listed as a tower defense game, and while it does have elements of that, I think it's selling the game short to call it a tower defense game. It's so much deeper than that, sliding back more towards RTS territory, which of course is where the tower defense genre came from. Essentially, you control a space ship that is trying to deliver cargo for various companies. The flights are always a straight line from left to right. In practice, this means your ship is mostly sitting in the middle of the screen as hazards approach from all directions. These hazards include asteroids, pirates, and competitor ships. Every time your destroy something, you get money, which can be used to build more guns and other ship systems like power generators, shields, and engines. The entire ship is made of interconnected hexagons, upon which you must place your ship components. The variety of guns is nice, with a handful of different lasers and projectile weapons to choose from. The bigger weapons need power to run, as do the special abilities you can add for all the weapons. There is a lot of strategy involved in placing weapons and the support systems, and on the later levels, you'll sometimes have to retry missions with different layouts to get an optimal configuration. But once your learn the ins and outs of weapons, and figure out how to set arrange your support systems, the game can become very satisfying, as you tear everything up with your big guns. Each company has its own type of cargo with its own special needs, and the cargos can hamper your ship in various ways. The most basic is taking up space, but they can also take up precious lines of sight needed for your guns, or explode violently when destroyed, inflicting extra damage to your ship. Another actively drains the energy from hexes around it. These add some interesting flavor to the various missions. You get credits for completing missions, with more credits for more perfect completions of missions. The great thing is, you can retry missions for more credits as much as you want, so if later missions are too tough, you can build up your ship powers on earlier missions for a while until you're able to pass the later missions. The great thing about this game is that even losing is fun, and you never feel like the game is being cheap. You get warnings for all ship and asteroid approaches, so you have time to plan for whichever direction they're coming from. Things can get pretty hectic, but I often find that better planning can alleviate the problem enough to make levels passable. And on the tough levels, it's pretty great to squeeze through by the skin of your teeth. I've never had to retry a level more than maybe five times at the absolutely most to beat it, and I've been having an absolute blast. The audio design is nice, with big sounds for all the weapons and other effects, while the voice acting is solid enough that you won't think much of it. But the story is thin at best. It's all about the gameplay here. The graphics are pretty nice, with cool visuals for most for the weapons and other systems. Destroying enemy ships is nice and satisfying. I can't really find many flaws with this game. It's very focused on what it's trying to do, and it does it well. If you're looking for a deeper action/strategy game. Highly recommended!\n",

      "Original: A great game focused on building ships from a variaty of parts and weapons, and useing them to fly around fighting other ships. The ship creation is extremely fun and you can spend hours at a time in it trying to make a perfect ship, though there are few blocks that just don't seem to fit in due to being just the wrong size or shape, the presented challenge of working around this sometimes makes it even more fun working out a good combination between makeing the ship look good and makeing it work well(and not have weak points that one shot will disconnect half you're ship). The other part of the game, focusing of flying and fighting is also a huge amount of fun, you can really feel the weight of the larger ships and it is always fun to kill a tiny ship with a shot the same size as it. The only limiting factor in this part of the game is the fleet of ships you can build and make, as they seem to lack a bit in the way of AI and commands you can give them, and they tend to just fly around in circles, get in the way, or get lost behind you and leave the fleet because they are too far away. That said it is awesome atacking a huge cluster of spikey plants (or as i call them lag plants) with a massive fleet of ships that you desigened and basicly melting them of the asteroids they cover. All in all this is a great game for those with a creative streak and spaceship lovers, but keep in mind that if you try to go for the completionist achievement, you are in for the long haul, and may be driven slightly insane.\n",

      "Original: Bugs: - Sometimes had trouble moving ships. - Sometimes terraformers didn't work. - When trying to trash a card for resources, sometimes it would select your artifacts instead. - Achievements didn't trigger correctly: eg, it gave me the 'horde 50 resources' achievement when I had 10, but probably triggered after *earning* 50 resources total. Either a typo in the achievement or a bug. - The end game stats were wrong. Claiming no ships were destroyed or lost (maybe because animations were off?) Negative Areas: - The game took some experimenting to figure out the mechanics, but there isn't much to figure out. - No resource management: All your planets generate exactly one resource that goes into a global pool - Battle mechanics are really unclear. It *feels* like risk, where more attack power gives higher dice roll chances. This means weaker armies can win battles. - Everything about the game felt like it was designed for mobile, which is only bad because I have a huge screen and it doesn't take advantage of the full range of inputs (keyboard, mouse) available. - None of the cards seemed worthwhile. Most had random effects, but according to users on the Steam forums some of them can target your own empire, which makes them difficult (actually impossible) to use effectively for strategy. - Most cards obtained were just 'use for a single resource', but required three clicks to convert. - Not clear when terraformers would work. - The battle animations were dry, and I decided to turn them off in the second game, which effectively turned the game into checkers. - It wasn't clear which ships were moving, or if a ship needed orders to move. - The only way to see which ships are on a planet is to cycle through each one. And the biggest complaint - NO fleet management. When a planet has 10 ships on it, you need individually select each one and move it. The biggest help is that after choosing to move the first ship, the next ship is already selected for you. Some features that would make it interesting: - Any kind of planet management or customization. Planets can only produce one of any ship in the game. They also can either be terraformed to boost resources (once), or never. - Any kind of tech tree. All ships are buildable from the start. All planets are colonizable from the start. - Meaningful race differentiation, right now they are too similar. - Planets that matter. Currently all planets are the same, no difference between them. - Better cards that can be used more specifically. Less 'convert card to one resource' cards. This game really feels like early access, or some kind of beta. It needs more features to be a worthwhile game, espscially at a $15 price point. The AI isn't challenging, and the game is incredibly flat. I have seen tactical games with less features but they were considered more deeply for their impact on the overall design and led to a highly focused but 'chess' like feeling. This game feels like checkers. Just move your slightly larger groups of units around one at a time until the enemy is eliminated. It isn't deep and it doesn't feel 'tactical', just rote movements until 'victory'.\n",

      "Original: Fantastic game stemming from a great concept: asymmetric multiplayer where 4 are treasure hungry divers, and 2 are just regular hungry sharks. I've seen many people comparing this to Evolve, and honestly at this stage I would recommend Depth over the AAA title. The game is well balanced: divers can set up around several points with sonar buoys, mines, and one shot weapons while their safe unlocking robot friend STEVE does his job, but a good shark team can easily wreak havoc even on a good set up. The water is murky and dark for divers, making sudden hit and run shark attacks jarring and terrifying as hell every time. Sharks depend much more heavily on good teamwork than the divers (one shark running decoy while another comes up from below works 100% of the time) and, much like Evolve, there is enormous pressure to do well as a shark in order for everyone to have a fun time. I recommend practicing against bots as a shark before your first game just to get a good feel for it. All in all, probably the most multiplayer fun I've had in a game for a long time. You also shake your mouse vigorously whenever you have a diver in your jaws to kill them. That alone should sell you the thing right there.\n",

      "Original: If you're a sucker for design-it-and-fail kind of games (like I am), then this game will be the crack to your addiction. The simplistic parts that you get to design your ship with is all you need to create the coolest looking space-ships this side of the galaxy. It's not as simple as 'plug the device on and go', you need to build your ship CORRECTLY or it won't maneuver through space! Don't have enough retro-thrusters? You better hope you can back off the enemy fast enough by turning (and not dying from losing your back end). Didn't think you needed thrusters to turn? Guess you're going in one direction infinitely. It's a constant failure zone, and I just LOVE IT! It's a very grindy game, so if you don't like grinding, I would certainly stay away. And the sandbox mode isn't very intuitive either. I tried to build something in the constructor (in the sandbox mode), and I didn't even get things to build with. Don't get fooled with sandbox mode, it isn't a free build-any-ship-for-free mode If you don't mind grinding as you play different factions (have to unlock them), then you'll find HOURS upon HOURS trying new designs and seeing if they stack up with the best. 24 hours of Gameplay later: This game is even better! Again the game is grindy, but the different factions (without mods) force you to build your ships in different patterns. Have a good design for faction 1 (Terrans)? You're not using it on Faction 4 because there are no long-triangle blocks! The only downside with ship-building, is when you test your ship against others' you need to fight these really cheap min-maxed ships that do nothing but fly backwards when your ship catches up with every default ship in the game; actually it's the CPU attacking the other ships, but it's still cheap tactics that win. Also, the sandbox mode isn't as convoluted as I first thought. I can create any ship I want with the right commands, and even see the default ship palettes for each faction. Unfortunately this isn't explained very well and you need a tutorial outside of the game to understand which commands do what (and that Faction 1 is actually Faction 8 for example). You can still build any ship you want in your save game, but the sandbox is very misleading (not much of a sandbox :/ More of a programmer's blank sheet of paper). I'm still getting my money's worth out of the game; Time to conquer the galaxy!\n",

      "Original: This game is extremely fun, but I suggest against getting it until it is more developed. Unless you have an n-key rollover keyboard, the lack of customizable controls makes gameplay extremely glitchy. An AI would be nice, but making one would take a considerable amount of work. Online multiplayer would also be nice, but that's not very realistic for an indie game. The main thing bugging me right now is the keyboard - although the developer is not to blame for keyboard glitches, he could certainly help immensely by investing an hour or two to create customizable controls - I simply do not get why the dev does not make the controls customizable. I would definitely recommend it once controls become customizable. Right now, for example, if a keyboard is being shared, player 2 cannot jump if player 1 is mining to the right! That's a pretty big glitch, considering jump is pretty important, and player 1 mines to the right a lot (the whole point of the game is mining). Although experiences may differ from keyboard to keyboard, I think it suffices to say I have a machine worth over $1000 and it has a fairly decent keyboard. I would give it a 5/10 in its current state, as glitches make it nigh unplayable with almost every keyboard 8/10 with customizable controls 9/10 if an AI is added 10/10 with online multiplayer\n",

      "Original: What if you awoke one morning to find yourself inside a truck? What if you woke up in that truck and from that moment on you were never hungry again? Well sure, that would be interesting, but, you'd still want to eat, right? You might reach for the handle to let yourself out of the truck, but the door doesn't open. You try the other door with similar results. One day you woke up inside a truck, and now that truck is your home, your prison for the rest of your life. The truck will be your tomb when you die. How would you react to that fate? Would you panic? Would you go mad? Would you run the truck off a cliff, would you rather die than endure that grim reality? Would you risk Hell to escape Arizona? Or would you go to work? American Truck Simulator tells the tale of a person trapped inside a truck, which is itself trapped in the southwestern United States. You may drive anywhere you wish, but you may never exit your truck. There is an option to work jobs carrying freight around to earn money, although all this money can be used for is buying more trucks and garages. You can't buy food. You can't go out on a date with someone. You can't sleep in a bed. You can't speak to your family. You can't signal for help. Your only means of interacting with the world outside the cabin of your truck is by driving and moving things from one place to another. The more you drive, the more the desert landscape begins to resemble an alien world. As far as you're concerned, Nevada may as well be Mars. It might be just outside your window but you'll never be able to set foot on that dusty orange soil. You belong to the truck now. You're just a part of the truck. You can't remember the taste of food, but the truck keeps you alive, somehow. And every time you stop for gas, every gas station taunts you with its disgusting, mouth-watering gas station food. That food you will never taste again. That love you'll never see again. That life you'll never have again. The bell dings, the tank is full. How long would you have to drive, before you forgot? How many miles of highway do you have to burn before you've burned away the person you used to be? Would you surrender to the truck? Would you be the best truck driver you could be? Would you build a trucking empire from the confines of your diesel-powered oubliette? Would you become a job provider, enriching the community for all the normal, regular people from whom you are now permanently isolated? Maybe they would even try to find a way to get you out of the truck. They wouldn't succeed, because the truck needs you now. The truck needed you so it could become alive. The truck lives through you. You are host to a giant, steel parasite, a mechanical macrovirus that can only live by stealing life from the living. And now that it is alive, it desires to persist. You couldn't drive off a cliff if you wanted to, because now, you don't want to. Now you are thinking for two, and one of you really just wants you to drive around and deliver freight. Now you wouldn't dream of driving off a cliff. And dream you do, though the truck may quell your hunger and thirst, it does not rob you of your need to sleep. The truck wants to dream, too. The dreams are exciting and strange, frightening and exhilarating, but the details always escape your mind moments after you awake. With each passing slumber, the memories of the life you used to have make you feel more alive than ever. Yes, you had a normal, mundane existence before the truck, because you are alive. The very thought that you are alive fills you with excitement. Alive, finally, ready to drive all over this beautiful country. Everything you see through your windshield looks new again, every color is brighter, richer, younger. This is life! There's a whole world out there, waiting to be discovered. There's folks out there, good, honest, American folks who need things transported, and you're the biomechanical lichenous organism that's going to do the job. Not for the glory, not for the money, but because you love your fellow American living things. If you had a way to communicate with your parents, you know they would be proud of you. Not just for being alive, but for being the best truck-driver symbiont you could be. Even so, they'll go the rest of their lives thinking that you were dead. Ironic, when this is the most alive you've ever felt! Ah, life. Life is just, better, in a truck.\n",

Don't get me wrong, American Truck Simulator is the same game as Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's a different map, different trucks, but the game is the same. However, in saying that, I feel American Truck Simulator is funner to play personally, and I haven't touched ETS2 since. You actually feel as if you ware driving through actual cities. The enviroments, I've driven down the same road 10 times, and still notice something new. American Trucks, in my opinion, are much funner to drive. While the map does skip some accuracy, it still feel similar. Driving through California feels like driving through California. I am a really happy camper, and plan on purchasing upcoming Map DLC to support these devs. FOR YOU LINUX USERS: I fully converted to Linux full time (no dual boot) in September 2015, and I must say, the Linux Version is remarkable. I have a GTX 980 and use Nvidia Proprietary Drivers (keep that in mind) and the performance is on par with the Windows Version. I even use a Logitech G27. No issues whatsoever. I'd give the SCS team a high five for this. Remarkable. My ONLY Complaint about this game, is still the lack of Force Feedback on Logitech G27 (and other wheels) under Linux. It's purely a Game Issue, as the Linux Beta for ETS2 had Force Feeback, then it was removed and never fixed. Force Feedback works flawlessly on every other game. If they would fix this, I would be so so grateful.\n",

      "Original: This game is not the most realistic map wise but it sure gives you a good, relaxed feeling from hauling a bunch of cargo. American Truck Simulator is built on the same engine as Euro Truck Simulator 2 so it's similar to Euro Truck Simulator in many different ways. From that same engine, it allows me to play American Truck Simulator as well as Euro Truck Simulator on my laptop without many performance issues. I cannot wait for more states but I don't want them to be pay to play like the expansions in Euro Truck Simulator 2. This is becoming more addicting like Euro Truck Simulator 2, I love it!\n",

      "Original: My impressions of American Truck Simulator after about 5 hours in game. Good: Scenery is good compared to alot of sims out there. Sounds let you really feel the power of the truck road system is good and makes more sense in some cases than the actual roads. Same solid gameplay of ETS2 fame. Neutral: The game itself is for all intent and purpose still Euro truck sim 2, just with american trucks and so if your a fan of ETS2 its good, if not well this title probably wont be your cup of tea either. Only two but with quite a few chassis/body options: Personally I prefer this to 20 fake you may find it limiting so I list it as a nuetral. Controls I don't have a steering wheel so I can only speak to but the truck don't seem to handle aswell as their ETS2 counterparts. Of course that could also just be my opinion so take it with a grain of salt. Environment; this is different from scenery to me because graphically its nice, but seriously there are more vehicle in america than 1950's cruisers, RV's, Semi's, and cops. Fines: Holy crap police presence. There is no escaping the fines in this ETS2 gave you speed traps that once you learned where they were you could slow down for em. Here? every third car is a cop who can and will pull you over for 4mph over the speed limit. Nice because it forces you to treat it more like a but a tad over done IMO. Bad: Smallish map, I get more is coming I really and I wish I didn't have to list this as a but when you can run any route before you've even maxed your distance well thats not beuno. AI; its been a plague on this series even in ETS2 and it didn't get any smarter same stupid 4wheelers doing stupid things right into the side of your truck. TL/DR If you are a diehard fan of truck games buy it, if you like sims buy it. If you want a finished US map with a 48 states and a total overhaul from well maybe wait awhile and catch it on sale after some more content has released.\n",

      "Original: As for those who have played Euro Truck Simulator 2, you will find this game to be very much similar. Truthfully, the only really noticeable differences would have to be the landscape(s), traffic, trucks, The performance and everything is slightly better, (in my case), and it was excellent to begin with in ETS2. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the ETS series, and for anyone thinking of trying out the series for the first time. As for the newcomers, keep in mind this is not a game designed for freeroaming, constantly popping in and out of any vehicle you want, or for professionally managing a business; it's a truck driving sim. You drive trucks under an employer until you make enough money to buy your own truck. From there on you haul various types of cargo to build your wealth. You then move on to expand your garage(s), buy more trucks, hire drivers, and make money. From a broad standpoint, yes it does simulate business, but that's not the primary goal of the game; it's for driving trucks. Summary summed up: if you want to drive anything you please any time or manage a business from a professional standpoint, this game is not what you're hunting. If you want to drive a semi, (and make money doing so), haul lots of different things, and design trucks for your employees to drive, this is what you want.\n",

      "Original: To be clear this isn't a bad game however when compared with Euro Truck sim 2 it’s hard to recommend this game over it. If you’re an American this may be different but the appeal to me is to drive around with my truck following the laws of the road and enjoying myself. I know that many people won’t enjoy this style of game, but then again I don’t enjoy Fifa (other football and sport games are available). The game looks much better than European truck simulator the cities and even down to small details such as cracks in the road. At the end of a job the parking process is much better as you get to choose how you want to park selecting from what is effectively; hard, medium and don’t park. The increase in fuel stations is good as in euro truck you could only buy fuel in a city if you had a garage upgraded. The coast roads look absolutely incredible (but with faster trucks in euro truck would be more fun there). I know more trucks and roads are coming but I find myself thinking why don’t I just play euro truck instead? The current engines available are low on power and the GPS likes taking you down extremely small roads. Also The game makes the ‘highways’ have more bends in them than the motorways in Britain and Europe. The police surprise attack you every moment you are speeding and they are very sneaky arriving just after a 30 sign that I happen to miss seeing. When you finally crawl up to speed on a ‘highway’ you are forced to slow down as the road just arrives in a city or town that you have no idea about until you either get fined for speeding or crash into cars waiting for traffic lights!!! In conclusion although American truck Simulator is a good simulator I still feel like Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a better game. On euro truck I have put in 110+ hours (had none steam version for a while) and I have experienced that game to about the full whereas American truck simulator I only have about 3 hours of which I know isn’t a lot but still it is difficult for me to recommend. So in it's current state I cannot recommend this game, with more trucks and roads in future this may alter my view. *Disclaimer* I know more trucks and roads are coming and I know that you can get mods for removing the police and increasing engine sizes but I wanted to play this game properly but despite this I wasn’t levelling up very quickly and I wanted to see what truck options were available so I had to use an XP cheat mod so I could see the options. Edit: The traffic light situation was improved but the game still isn't as good as ETS2\n",

I get a lot of satisfaction exploring, solving puzzles, and wandering the world. Even organzing my food, water, and other stashed items on the shelves of the empty shelters I find feels good in gameplay. There's something special about being able to reach out, interact with the world around you with your hands, and make it feel like your 'home', however temporary. The atmosphere it gives is quite alien, and leaves you with a sense of risk associated with your actions.

      "Original: Played it with Vive System. I sure haven't played it that I got motion sickness as I've never felt before after a few minutes of gameplay: you cannot turn you head around because the view is blocked by the helmet, so you have to use the trackpad to move the view and you'll probably feel sick by doing so. Try this while doing a barrel roll (which is often required to adjust the tilt) may lead to imminent barf. The game is visualy quite realistic though, because I was instinctively afraid to barf in my IG Helmet, but I really did not find it as immersive as other VR experiments and games. This may be due to the controls which are not very friendly. I'm aware that evolving in a newtonian physics space void is quite tricky, but the controls aren't intuitive (on the Vive at least), and going from bottles of 0² to bottles of O² is not as enjoyable as I thought, and becomes even tedious. Vive controllers are not that useful, you can still punch into flying object which is quite enjoyable, but also breaks the immersion as you still see the hands of your character doing something else. Not being able to rotate your view properly is a really poor choice in a VR game, even if I understand the realistic approach behind it. Adr1ft was one of those games who made me buy a VR system, but in fact it looks like it is a Non-VR game that wanted to be VR, but that cumulates too many mistakes to be immersive and pleasant. Maybe you could give it a try on a flat screen, I guess it would be more enjoyable, but I'm not sure it would have a lot of interest. I've asked my first steam refund for this game, 'nuf said.\n",

      "Original: It's easier to figure out what Town of Salem is by reading the wiki and then playing it, so I'm not going to go super deep into that. Once I got a hang (heh) for it though, I found Normal mode extremely boring and predictable. Being able to know all available roles in the specific instance of the game you are playing gives Town too many advantages to pinpoint who is not Town; all that the Mafia, SK, Arso, WW, and Witch can do is pray they off enough Town to deny them majority voting power in the first two or three nights. The solution to this is All Any, a mode that has (almost) no restrictions on roles and doesn't advertise how many of which role or faction: the role list is simply 15 Any's. The complexity of the game from that point is practically infinite, because now the game is truly one of bluffing, counterbluffing, stealthily determining roles and factions, forming alliances that may coincide with your faction or not, and hoping you survive to the end (and most likely you won't, but someone's gotta die on night one and you have as good a chance as anyone else). Town of Salem reminds me a lot like poker. You know all the cards in the deck, but you don't know the hands that have been dealt except your own. Eventually, as time goes on, clues will hint at the other player's hands. Sometimes you get dealt a pair but you swap out two trash cards and are dealt two cards that turn your pair into a full house that fundamentally transforms the game. Sometimes the game plays out exactly like it looks, a stomp for one side or another. Sometimes people who should carry the game for you are complete idiots; sometimes you have a great role and get roleblocked AND slaughtered by three people night 1. It's a brilliant combination of luck, skill, game knowledge, and deception that make the game a classic for me. So yes, you should hang out with this game.\n",

      "Original: Town of Salem is an unpredictable whodunnit?-styled game, based on the Salem Witch Trials. You never know who you can trust and therefore the game always ends differently. I have been playing this game for a while now, firstly in my browser but decided to purchase it on steam. You get a certain amount of town points and you also get to support the developers when you purchase it. It's more comfortable and less laggier than browser-version. It's definitely a nice game to enjoy with friends or even to just pass the time. The best part of the game is, is the fact that you never know who's making it alive. It's hard but it's not impossible. Pro's: ---------- - Endless fun as the game never ends the same way. - You will have loads of fun playing with friends if none of you reveal your identity. - A good game to waste some time with. Cons: ---------- - It might be a little difficult to understand at first, but you should get a hang of it after the first few games. - After the developers implemented the 'merit' currency it became tough to acquire skins, pets etc. though the town points do not cost that much to purchase. Verdict: ---------- Since the game is not that expensive at all, I would recommend that you get it. It's definitely worth it.\n",

      "Original: Town of Salem is presented somewhat in the style of an animated board game, pitting fifteen people against each other in a clever roleplay battle of wit, perception, strategy, and deception. A quick recount of a fun session I played. In a recent game, I was the serial killer. That means I can kill at night and can not be killed. All I have to do is keep killing people, keep deceiving them, and not leave any clues for them to suspect me. I won this specific game, because there was a player named Snoop Dogg and every time I killed someone, I would leave a 'death note' with a vague dog-related reference on the victim - even some as obtuse as 'Bow down before the Lion'. This made people increasingly suspicious that this other player was the serial killer, without focusing any suspicion on myself. Yet, I (feigning to be a good guy) kept raising questions about yet *another* player, so that the town never had enough votes in agreement about Snoop Dogg to have him put on trial. Keeping Snoop Dogg alive meant I could keep killing with impunity. Until there were so few townsfolk left that I was able to kill Snoop Dogg, get away with it, and win the game. So what is the gameplay? When you start each game, you can pick new name. Some people choose generic and some are clever. It's the internet, so plenty are offensive. When the game starts, all fifteen players will be told what their role is. Each role comes with certain abilities, traits, alignments, and limitations. The goal is to play your role, while supporting your faction. Each role has different faction alignments. Some are aligned with the mafia and the town. Some are aligned with the town and witches. Some, like the serial killer, are aligned only with the survivors. The game is broken up into rounds. Your activities are performed at night. If you're the serial killer, you kill at night. If you're the investigator, you investigate one person's information each night. If you're the mafia, you communicate privately with the other mafia and the godfather at night, about who to kill and then you kill them. If you're the jailor, you put someone in jail overnight. If you're the escort, you distract someone overnight. Then there are limitations. For example, the serial killer can not kill the mafia's godfather. So if you choose to kill someone overnight, but are not able to, there's a good chance you (as the serial killer) have just identified who the god father is. When the night is over, you get a tally of the dead and how they died. You can read their will (each player can write a will, which for some is just a clever or insulting quip, but for others is an on-going ledger of information they've gathered while playing, so that upon their death, other players are informed as to what that player knew). Still in the day phase, everyone votes on who to execute, if anyone. If enough votes are tallied for an individual, that person has to plead their defense to the town (in their own words). The town can then determine if they find him guilty or innocent. If he's guilty, he is hung. After his death (as with all deaths), his name goes up on a visible list for all to see, along with their role. (As an aside, there are also mediums - who are the only players who can communicate with the dead players in chat, using their information for themselves or to share with the living to inform future judgments). It will often play out something like this: Someone accuses a player of being the godfather. Everyone votes for that person. That person swears they are the sheriff and the town needs them. Nobody buys their lies. They hang him. Then the name and role appears on the grave they were telling the truth! They were the sheriff! Uh oh! And then night comes again and we carry out the rounds like this, until almost everyone is dead and the town, mafia, serial killer, or other faction is left alive and declared the winner. There are a few small hurdles that may trip some up. They are worth dealing with. First, this is a free-to-play browser-based game that is now also on Steam for $5 USD. Those $5 are converted to ingame currency to buy cosmetic items like death animations or houses. There is no pay-to-win aspect to the game; only cosmetic items. You also accrue currency simply by playing, so you could play with no disadvantage whatsoever without ever paying a dime. Second, the game requires you to install Adobe AIR, so if this isn't already on your system, it will direct you to install it before the game runs. You'll also need to create a game account. Click 'register' from the game's interface to be taken to the web page where you do this. The page it takes you to is a sign-up for a forum account, which may seem confusing. Just do it, as the account is directly tied to your game login. When you're done, login to the game with those credentials. Third, when you go to play a game, you'll have the options 'invite friends' and 'solo'. This is very misleading, but if you click 'solo', you will actually be entering the online multiplayer, which is what you obviously want. Overview. The game is addictive and allows for a lot of role playing and deception. Even with fourteen other total strangers. Depending on the mode you are playing, there are also somewhere between 15 and 30 different roles to be played. Vigilante, veteran, doctor, mafioso, framer, godfather, spy, jailor, sheriff, escort, serial killer, witch, werewolf, arsonist, executioner, survivor, amnesiac, forger, vampire hunter, vampire, janitor, disguiser, consort, consigliere, blackmailer, bodyguard, investigator, lookout, mayor, medium, retributionist, transporter, The game becomes a clever meeting of wits, suspicions, piecing together what you know about roles and how they interact with each other, lying, determining truth, banding together, and backstabbing. It is absolutely unique and so compelling that I played six hours straight the first time I launched the game. The game is a no-brainer at the price of zero dollars, if you play the web version. Frankly, it's worth $5 USD for the Steam version, too. If you're unsure, try the web version and decide if you'd like to support the guys behind this game by kicking in the $5 on Steam and getting this version. It also doesn't seem like there are a lack of players. Even past midnight, there were more than 300 ongoing games being played by almost 4,000 players. I never waited to get into a lobby and lobbies are filled and launched into the game within about one minute. I can't implore you enough to give this game a shot, if any of this sounds even remotely compelling to you.\n",

      "Original: I've decieded to give this a bash because I saw Isaac Schankler was involved with the project and I really liked his work with Analogue and Hate Plus. People have been bringing up the controversy with Quinn, but here's the thing: it has nothing to do with Depression Quest so I could care less about someone's personal life simply because it was never my business to begin with so lets move away from that and actually talk about the 'game'. Depression Quest is simply a choose you own adventure kind of ordeal touching upon the subject of depression and I have mixed feelings on how the subject matter was handled. I do like on how it simulated the feeling of depression since there is a sense of hopelessness in the world, but what also irritates me is that they crossed out choices that makes a real positive impact in your life and forces you to remain in a state of depression for the entire run, which for those people who are currently or formerly depressed might not find this helpful in any shape or form (at least they gave us a warning about suicidal thoughts). You are basically just some guy in his twenties who currently is in a state of depression possibly because of an inferiority complex constantly comparing himself with his friends and family including his significant other. Unfortunately the soundtrack basically consists of one track on a loop the entire time and for me, it did not deliver much of an impact so that was pretty disapointing because if Depression Quest wasn't good, (which it wasn't) I was hoping the music would at least make up for it. Despite having multiple 'endings', I had no desire to go back and find out what they are because I feel it would be similar to one another, which is falling into despair with no chance of self redemption with the best 'ending' is continuing to assess your condition which in no way it feels reassuring which is the purpose of this 'game' and it acheives it. I do not know much about depression other than it negatively affects the relationships of those around the victim, so to end this, I can only say to those who is or knows someone that is depressed, try to be patient and get assistance as soon as possible.\n",

      "Split: this game fails in all it intends to be ; it ' s not interactive, it ' s not entertaining nor is it particularly well written. it doesn ' t give depression more publicity, nor does it really make anyone who doesn ' t suffer from depression understand it better. it is, at best, an insensitive attempt to create an interactive story around a buzzword. i cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anyone, as if you have depression it will make you feel worse, and if you don ' t it will build upon the stereotypes society already has built up around the illness. if you want to play a thoughtful game about the subject, please go and buy actual sunlight. it is much better. please, if you feel you ' re suffering from depression, reach out to someone, and if you know someone else who is, encourage them. don ' t be like this game.\n",

      "Original: Quite possibly the most addicting game I have in my Library. What makes Boson X so great? It's simple formula. You jump from one platform to the next, trying to land on the blue ones to fill up an energy bar. When the energy bar gets to 100%, you have completed the level. But you can keep playing to try and increase your score even further. Sounds simple? It is! Only it gets harder as you go. Much harder. First, the levels keep speeding up as your score gets higher, which makes an already hectic game even more hectic. Levels also get harder, much harder. The difficulty jump between the first and the last level in the game is astronomically high. Soon you will deal with more hazards. Platforms that drop once you step on them, platforms that come at you with speed and lightning bolts of DEATH are just a few examples of what you will have to deal with. Some levels are just pure evil! Platforms coming at different angles, entire levels spinning around and jumps that at first seem impossible to make. Boson X is a really fun ride from the very beginning to the very end. While we are on the subject, let's talk about replay value. I have completed this game in about 7 hours. And as of writing this review, I have 71 hours on record and I expect that Boson X will soon join the 'Over 100 hours' Club. Why? Two words. Steam Leaderboards. This is the prime reason why I bought Boson X. I'm not a very competitive person by nature and most of the games I play are single player. But Boson X is an exception. The fact that I have a leaderboard where I can check my scores against other players provides a constant challenge for me. And it fuels the addicting part of the game. I want to go as high as I can on leaderboards. Even thought I have replayed a level close to 1k times, I still want to improve myself. That is incredibly fun. Having a lot of bad runs and then having one great run that pushes you up the leaderboard gives you a big a sense of accomplishment. And then you want more, more, more, MORE! :) The graphics are very simple, but they just work. Some levels look amazing, almost like you are in a different world. The sound design is just right. The sound when you run on the blue platform and your score increases is the best sound in the world. The music is simple. Each level has two loops that last about 15 seconds each. But the music works so well and is so charming that I didn't even notice how short the loops are. They just fit the game and what's going on the screen. I only have one minor complaint and that is that I sometimes get random FPS lag where my FPS drops from otherwise rock solid 60 FPS to around 40 FPS. The FPS lag usually clears up quickly if it starts in the middle of the run. And if the lag starts at the beginning of the run, I simply restart the level. I don't think that's the game, I think that's my machine and OpenGL being a bit funky. But It's nothing major. Otherwise, the game is polished and has no bugs. Still not sure if you want this game or not? Try the free version then! Boson X started as a free game, which later released on Steam with more content and Steam Leaderboards. So if you like the free version, get this one to support the amazing devs and get 12 more levels and 2 more playable characters. The price is fair compared to how many potential hours of fun you can get out of the game. PS: This game is hard by the way. Super hard. It's one of those games that you are going to pull out your hair while playing. If that sounds fun to you, get the game. You won't regret it.\n",

      "Original: AdVenture Capitalist could be described as a single-player Facebook game. Your goal is to earn money by purchasing additional businesses and upgrades for those businesses. You start off with a few bucks and a dream of a lemonade stand, and within a few days of playing will be the owner of several dozen oil companies. There are ten business types in all, with each one being progressively more profitable (and expensive) than the last. Each purchase of an individual business type makes the next more expensive. Your first lemonade stand will cost you about a dollar and change, whereas your four hundred and first lemonade stand will cost you over two trillion dollars. You earn money by clicking on a business type and letting a countdown expire, much like how Facebook games deal with gameplay elements. Fortunately, you can quickly and cheaply hire managers who will auto-click for you. Given that a few upgrades to your first couple of businesses means they collect faster than you can click in one second, that's very helpful. The downside is that there isn't really anything to do except check back every now and then (the game continues while offline) and buy businesses. Eventually, you can 'sell' your enterprise and receive some angel investors, who give you a 2% bonus to earnings apiece and can be cashed in (only in vast quantities) for bonuses to earning. Once sold, you just start over and do the same thing again, but faster. This is the only way to effectively 'beat' the game, since you can be earning and spending amounts of money that mathematics barely has names to describe. Pros: + AdVenture Capitalist is very easy to learn and get into + The game plays itself even offline, so you can check back in whenever you're free to + It's a good time killer in the early stages, as you micromanage your first few hundred businesses + You'll learn words for counting sums of money you've never imagined before + This is a free game, and the cash store is optional and not needed to play Cons: - This is a single-player game, so you can't compete with friends without a bit of imagination - The gameplay is pretty shallow, with not much to do once you learn a few basic purchasing strategies - You'll very quickly run out of the ability to do anything thanks to the cost of purchasing, forcing you to wait hours so you can afford to spend 20 seconds buying more businesses Final Verdict: AdVenture Capitalist is a fun little time-waster, and even though there isn't really much to do while playing it can help alleviate boredom. If you hate Facebook games that make you wait for countdowns you may not enjoy this game, although I dislike Facebook games and find it to be kind of neat. If you need to kill some time and want to experience earning scientific notation sums of money, then the game is worth picking up. Even if you don't like it, the game is free and you won't need to waste a cent of your money.\n",

The story has you as a Van Helsing style dispatcher of evil who gets letters from various parties who have some supernatural trouble, and a rating for how difficult it is (1-5 stars), some of the letters will be story missions which advance the plot, or you can do side missions to try to find those extra bits of equipment you are missing. Unfortunately if you want to find them all that will take quite a while (and is very luck dependant), and things will probably start getting a bit monotonous, but if you limit it to just doing some of the side quests and run through the storyline you probably won't be struck as much by the limitations of the amount of enemy types, locations/maps and missions.

      "Original: 10/10 BEST HIPSTER GAME I don't think a lot of people don't see the value in Mountain, and when people do they tend to simply overcomplicate the game for what it is. It's not meant to be a 'game' exactly. The developers of the game purposefully say this originally: 'Leave it open - it's designed to run in the periphery of your life. Only interact with it when you feel like it. You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself. '. Again Mountain is just mean to be left open and you can return to it when you feel like it. You might not see the aspect of it originally but you can find it later… hopefully. But then again, what are the standards of a 'game'? Are we to simply segregate Mountain simply because it is possibly outside of the norm? On the contrary! Different experiences lead to different viewpoints which make you more open-minded. So can people truly state that Mountain is not a game but a screensaver? There are many ways to view Mountain and seeing it as a screensaver is one of the more popular demoralizing viewpoints to which many have so acquired. So one can only view Mountain as simply a standalone and not compare it to more contemporary issues. Or one can compare it but by doing so one loses the face value of the game itself. I think I've settled for now the dispute that this 'game' might be a screensaver or simply not a 'game' at all. On another note, the developers stated this: 'If you're having an annoying storm or boring night, play a melody (using your keyboard) and time will Mountain is there for you when you decide to return to it and play it. I think that is a common misconception. It's not as much meant to be a 'game' but rather a subsidiary and supporting game next to you. Yet there are many ways to view Mountain as with any form of issue in life. But the Way Mountain was constructed, at times unappealing to the eye, allows it to show you a different path and possibly one you may not have seen before hand. But you don't have to follow what the developers say. A 'game' is meant to be played whichever way you feel like it. If you feel like you've been cheated off by buying this game, then take two steps back and think about the aspects of this 'game' and the elements. Perhaps you begin to notice that wonderful ambient sound that plays amidst the night, or perhaps you fall in love with the way the streaks of the sun touch your Mountain. But you might not have to like all these things to truly enjoy the game. Perhaps you have all these games and you developed a love for the game. Or perhaps you try to ridicule the game but in turn you've actually Grown accustomed to the game. I for one cannot answer that question of whether a gamer should like this or not, but it is all up to the gamer who buys it, and whether he is willing to open up his heart and mind. Now is the Mountain truly your Mountain and your own property? I think that is in the conception of the gamer alone for the gamer can make notion whether the Mountain truly is a self embodiment, or the player truly controls the Mountain. Does the Mountain not speak to us and tell us of its thoughts? Or is it conveying a hidden message to where we might be its own spawn and it is the master. Whichever way you see fit, there are quite a lot of ways to see Mountain, as with any game. Mountain might not have a storyline, no shooting, no love triangle (unless you begin to make one up between somehow the items, the Mountain, and the sky in which case you probably might have gone a bit too far), but Mountain contains a moment of solitude in which you might notice things in games that can be recurrent in Mountain. Perhaps Mountain might contain all these elements in which you create the story. Mountain can always be a storyline in which you, the gamer, is going along a path with the Mountain to a destination into your subconscious. There is much to do in Mountain and blocking your imagination and logic will only hinder it. But if you so choose to do so than you have not hurt no one but yourself in denying the possible powers in the 'game' itself. This review cannot display my neutrality toward the game but I only wish to explain to the gamer that Mountain can only be accentuated by only the gamer. And another thing many question is the role of the keyboard in the game. Although at first it may seem like the keys simply advance time and increase it in a way the human eye can perceive, Mountain is inevitably omnipresent and time is of little importance to him. Binding ourselves to this thought, we can perceive the passing of time as not one full of dread and dreariness, not one full of change and a different scenery, but becoming part of the universe and its infinite realm of possibilities. What we perceive as a minute can seem as nothing more than what has occurred to the Mountain. What we perceive as the future is simply the happening in the Mountain. What we perceive as the past is imply seen as the done by the Mountain. And another question still remains as to what is the value of the items that the Mountain contains and at times loses. Are those pieces of our memories or life lessons that we must cope to accept? Or are those as somewhat like to put it as simple items that simply 'fall' on the Mountain. No they are granted upon the Mountain and delivered first hand to the Mountain or possibly to you. And what is of this item leaving our grasp and floating off into space? Have we broken your heart, Mountain? Have we done some unforgivable act too which I've lost my pony? That alone can be answered only by the gamer and his affiliation with the mountain. And what of this inevitable destruction that reaches the doorsteps of the Mountain ever so often. Are we to simply ponder over the oblivion of the Mountain or sputter key notes to protect the Mountain? Or can we observe the Mountain and it's destruction in all its gloom and tidings of change too which a new Mountain is brought forth to bring new waves of joy to the gamer, too which the cycle is repeated. Why do we have the ability to protect the Mountain or is it even in our ability to protect it? Is it predestined that we protected or is it by our own free-will? That is something that neither I can answer you and only you can resolve either by justifying it or believing in something. This setting that surrounds the Mountain is quite serene and yet the darkness around it is quite opposite. Is this serving as a contrast between dark and light? The battle of how light destroys the darkness. Or perhaps the story has been switched and light is simply a harbinger of this cycle of death that is ever so dreaded upon. Again, I am not in any sort of ability to answer that question, and it alone can be sought through the Mountain. So if you ever feel hurt or saddened than perhaps a tune on the fashioned keyboard can mend your heart. Or perhaps a stressed out day simply requires a concerto done by your own imagination. And maybe in the end when you've discovered the infinite combinations on the keys that by which you alone and the Mountain as well contains in the hidden locks of memory, you realize all this and then come to think in terms of the Mountain, and how time is not congruent, but simply an assortment of things by which we alone can process and that by which we alone can control. Mountain is infinite and it is up to the gamer only to perceive the game as he wishes.\n",

      "Original: This game is as beautiful as ever and the soundtrack is still amazing. However, it feels like half a Trine game. The removal of skill points really dampens the character progression. Knowing that the skills you've got is all you're gonna get is really frustrating because I personally loved the skill tree in Trine 2. Trine 3 also diverts away from it's sidescroll nature by using a new 3D camera. This is a cool little feature but it doesn't really fit because it detracts from the orginal feel of the game. I haven't finished the game yet. I've heard the story is only 3-4 hours long. Which compared to Trine 2 is half the play time. Which is really disappointing considering the price. This is not a bad game. It's just not the Trine experience I was looking for. All it has succeed in doing for me so far is making me want to play Trine 2 again.\n",
      "Split: this game is as beautiful as ever and the soundtrack is still amazing. however, it feels like half a trine game. the removal of skill points really dampens the character progression. knowing that the skills you ' ve got is all you ' re gonna get is really frustrating because i personally loved the skill tree in trine 2. trine 3 also diverts away from it ' s sidescroll nature by using a new 3d camera. this is a cool little feature but it doesn ' t really fit because it detracts from the orginal feel of the game. i haven ' t finished the game yet. i ' ve heard the story is only 3 - 4 hours long. which compared to trine 2 is half the play time. which is really disappointing considering the price. this is not a bad game. it ' s just not the trine experience i was looking for. all it has succeed in doing for me so far is making me want to play trine 2 again.\n",

      "Original: Trine series are one of the best indie game series. As you see it is a 3D platformer game in some areas and Trine was platformer - puzzle game. Frozenbyte upgraded the game to 3D. Well Trine is stunning game. Trine series were always good looking to eye and has nice story. Sadly, Trine 3 has no imposive story which has an end nor hard and challenging puzzles. There were some money issues, that is why Trine 3 is not completed. There is very limited amount of chapters and you have unlock them, and of course some levels as like side quests. Ehm, I can say Trine 3's length is around 5-8 hours. Puzzles are not really challenging (when you compare them with the puzzles in Trine - Trine 2), our Wizard is way too overpowered to solve puzzles. There is only one real boss fight. Want a completed game with boss fights and challenging puzzles? Then get Trine 1 and 2. Stay away from this game for a while. Get it on sale. Trine 3's art syle and level design, musics (soundtrack-in game OSTs), even gameplay and combat are really deserves a congratulation. Story and levels are rollicking, espicially in co-op mode. Fair combats and parkour-platformer mechanics. Enough amount of puzzles. Round up ; + Stunning graphics and details + 3D and Gameplay + Different types of puzzles + Story is exciting and all ok. - Story is not completed. - Puzzles are easy to solve. - Levels and puzzles does not require team work enough - One step forward, two step forward if you compare it with other Trine games. - No boss fights, only one boss fight with health bar. It is the final boss fight. (Ehm, final boss fight for uncompleted story) - Couldn't do a much thing while in Early access. After Early Access, still couldn't do much thing and release content. At least our proud and brave heroes are reunited. 70/100\n",

CD is a great stress reliever. You just rush through the levels smashing as much as you can before the (relaxed) time limit passes. Throughout you gather upgrades that can make you faster, jump higher, or swat better -- and you collect photos of cats (and a few evil non-cats).

      "Original: This uncreatively titled piece strives to create a multiplayer-focused experience full of nonsensical, fast-paced lunacy. In my opinion, it doesn't do a very good job at it. Those who follow the work of TotalBiscuit may have heard him call it a cross between Super Smash Bros. and WarioWare. The meat of the game is found in four-player free-for-all deathmatches that consist of lightning-quick rounds that dump players in different stages and task them with finding armaments and fighting to be the last one standing before jumping into the next round. The WarioWare comparison is meant to illustrate how each round forces players to figure out what to do extremely quickly or promptly get killed by their opponents. While some may enjoy this aspect, I personally did not. Getting killed because I had yet to figure out what was happening, how the weapons and items worked, or which of the similarly-proportioned pixellated avians represented my character feels cheap, like I didn't have a chance to do anything. On top of that, it meant each round ended before I had a chance to enjoy what each of the maps had to offer. The presentation doesn't help the experience much. Sure, players can equip hats to help their characters stand out a bit more, but the quick movement speed, identical body proportions, pixelly art style, and frequently zoomed-out camera all make it very difficult to keep track of you and your opponents. Furthermore, the pixels also make it hard to tell what kind of weapon or item is being picked up. Is this a rapid-fire handgun or a slow-loading flintlock I just picked up? Oh, and the weapons' audio cues are nearly indistinguishable, compunded by the horribly bit-crushed sound design. Guns make the same sound effect when they need to be reloaded as they do when they have no ammo left and must be discarded. The end result is a game that struggles to properly convey feedback to the player about what is going on at any given time. The controls are lacking as well. Character movement speed is extremely fast, and the sudden acceleration to top speed makes it all too easy to miss a jump or walk off a ledge; not helpful in a game with 2-D platforming. Combine the twitchy positioning with an apparently unresponsive 'pick up' function, and the seemingly simple task of picking up a weapon becomes a consistent annoyance. It's especially annoying since, as was mentioned earlier, players start each round unarmed and must pick up a weapon. There's also a solo mode that consists of timed challenges meant to acquire unlocks and master the game's mechanics. It's not very good either. Possibly the biggest reason why is that it betrays the intended experience of random improvised insanity with challenges that require repetitous practice and finding a single optimal approach. It also suffers from Angry Birds Syndrome, whereby simply beating a level isn't enough to unlock new stages; you have to repeat beaten stages and win enough silver/gold medals to gain access to new levels. This game did not impress me. I found its design shallow, repetitive, and needlessly frustrating. Sure, one could make the argument that this game is meant to be played with friends, but I find that to be a poor excuse. Skinny dipping in a septic tank can be fun if done with friends. Besides, why would I go to the troube of persuading my friends to buy it when I can persuade them to buy games that all of us will enjoy both alone and with each other? It might be worth picking up for a couple of dollars, but otherwise, Duck Game can duck right off.\n",

You solve puzzles using a time manipulation mechanics, which are enhanced the further you go in the game. Levels also feature hidden collectibles which unlock more of the story. The puzzles are clever and really engaging. It is so fulfilling when you finally figure out what it is you need to do. I think that the puzzles are made to be engaging but not so obscure that you will never work out the answer without that is my opinion. The levels themselves look so beautiful and have actually spent time just waltzing through the levels alone and admiring the art and music. The game seems to draw on many aspects of gaming and comes into its own when you look at the game and its plot from a philosophical standpoint. It really makes you think and encourages you to do so.

      "Split: braid is a puzzle platformer. you play as tim, a guy attempting to rescue his princess from a monster. you explore 6 worlds, each with several levels filled with puzzles. you solve puzzles using a time manipulation mechanics, which are enhanced the further you go in the game. levels also feature hidden collectibles which unlock more of the story. the puzzles are clever and really engaging. it is so fulfilling when you finally figure out what it is you need to do. i think that the puzzles are made to be engaging but not so obscure that you will never work out the answer without that is my opinion. the levels themselves look so beautiful and have actually spent time just waltzing through the levels alone and admiring the art and music. the game seems to draw on many aspects of gaming and comes into its own when you look at the game and its plot from a philosophical standpoint. it really makes you think and encourages you to do so. replayability is limited with the beautiful art and music. once you complete the levels, find the hidden collctibles and see the ending, there isn ' t much to keep doing. the time trials extend replayability slightly, but not everyone likes time trials. despite this, i still think this is a game worth\n",

      "Original: Braid is a solid indie title with unique time based mechanics in a puzzle platformer along with great visual and sound design. Immediately upon starting the game, players are shown a rich looking world that resembles a painting. Throughout the game, this painted style along with intricately designed backgrounds looks gorgeous when playing the game along with providing some interesting designs for players to admire. The design manages to be distinct for each game element while looking beautiful for the parts that make up the land of the world. The music matches the refined style of the art with some instrumental pieces that accompany each level. The songs aren't loud in nature, but give a backdrop in each level for players to listen to while solving some of the puzzles. Each song sounds natural with the recorded instruments and still sound nice when applied with some audio effects caused by game events like rewinding time. The story seems at first to be about a man trying to rescue a princess, but the game goes beyond just that simple story. Throughout the game are books in each world that are read and provide deep meanings with symbolism. Thus, this story is taken more figuratively than literally, and can tend to be confusing much like the actual gameplay. The gameplay works as a puzzle platformer with unique time based mechanics. By default, the player can rewind time in each world, but each world has its own special mechanics that also deal with time. The player has to solve puzzles using this time mechanic, often with some precision platforming. Each of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, but the levels are designed such that the player can walk past a puzzle to solve it later. Some of the level designs are repeated in this game, but with new twists to be used with a new time based mechanic. The time based mechanics of Braid are amazing for solving the tricky puzzles while also being cool yet confusing when thinking about how some of the mechanics work. Although some of the puzzles can be a pain to figure out or time well with precise actions, Braid tends to be a short game at 5 hours, and maybe more if players are really stuck on some puzzles. Braid has its strong and unique puzzle gameplay while having good design and a story to think about. While the puzzles may be hard at times and the story a bit strange, this is a great indie title to check out and play for the different things it brings in the game.\n",

      "Original: When I played Braid in 2008, I didn't pay attention to one puzzle and finished the game using a walkthrough. Since then, I have matured as a gamer and I decided to revisit Braid. To my surprise, I began to complete puzzles without looking at walkthrough and by the end I completed the game completely without looking at a guide, except for one puzzle. Everyone knows what Braid is; it is famous for being pretentious, but thoughtful, confusing and difficult, enigmatic, but engaging. All of these adjectives could be valid, and I agree with some of them, but not all of them. Then, really it is up to you to make out what this game really is to you. At its core, it's a puzzle game. What I enjoy about the puzzles is that they don't require precision or finding specific objects to open other objects so that you can move forward, but instead require you to logically understand the mechanics in front of you. Each world has a few levels and each level have a few puzzles in them. There is a symbiosis between each puzzle in each level, meaning that if you understand what happens on the first puzzle then the next puzzle just adds to the second puzzle. Gosh, this makes the game feel gratifying since again, the mechanics are mostly due to you understanding the logic of the game. Now there are problems with a few puzzles. There are a 2 puzzles that require you to do a 'jumping trick', which I won't ruin for you, but I felt that these 2 puzzles really detracted from the overall clean puzzle design. That is my only problem with the games puzzles, but I also might not like these puzzles because one of the puzzles took me a few days to solve and the other one is the one puzzle I had to look online for the solution. Overall, you could play this game, but you don't have to. I enjoyed it, you might not. It's critically acclaimed, but so are a lot of games. Besides all of that, it's what you want from your game. I never liked puzzle games, but now that I have played this game, it's the only genre I want to play. Thank you, braid.\n",

      "Original: On the surface, Braid is a simple puzzle platformer. The gameplay, at its most basic level, consists of jumping on platforms and collecting puzzle pieces before moving to the next world. A couple of things set Braid apart and make it a fantastic experience. The first is the visuals. Everything in Braid is hand drawn, and it's quite a pleasure to progress through the game and see the different landscapes. Second; the puzzles. The puzzles in the latter stages of the game are, to say the least, mind-bending. You will have difficulty getting through Braid without a walkthrough for at least a couple of levels. Braid is best played in short burts; play for too long and the harder puzzles get frustrating. The puzzles themselves are brilliantly designed and are very satisfying to solve. The main gimmick of Braid is the ability to manipulate (reverse) time. It adds another dimension to puzzle solving and forces you to think about puzzles in abstract ways. Truthfully, Braid isn't for everyone, but it offers a unique gameplay experience for the puzzler fan.\n",

      "Original: Puzzle platformers tend to be platform games with a few easy puzzles. Braid is a puzzle games with some easy platform elements. The puzzle mechanic is one of the most innovative I have seen. It involves time manipulation and challenges you to think in new ways to predict the consequences of manipulating time in various ways and use this ability to achieve your goals. It starts out easy and the difficulty ramps up at a good pace. Towards the end the game is challenging even for experienced puzzle solvers. The game is also non-linear in that you don't need to solve everything in one part of the game to progress to later parts, if you get stuck on a puzzle you can go somewhere else and come back to tackle that puzzle later. The game has an artistic style that feels completely natural and fits well with the unique style of the gameplay. Graphics and sound contribute further to make the game atmospheric. The story is told in various ways, including texts you can read at the start of each level but also, in a way, through the pictures that you need to assemble to complete a level. All in all this is the best puzzle platformer I have played (unless you count Portal as a 3D puzzle platformer) and highly recommended to anyone who likes puzzle games.\n",

      "Original: What to Expect -------- Genre : Puzzle/Platformer (Heavy emphasis on puzzles!) 1st Playthrough : ~6 hours Standard Mode : consists of 6 puzzle-heavy worlds where you play as a Character named Tim in search of a princess who always seems to be in another castle. Speed Run : unlocked after beating the game once Gimmick : solve complex puzzles and avoid death by rewinding time. New mechanics are introduced in each world keeping gameplay fresh and impossible to master. Compare : Super Mario movement, Prince of Persia time mechanics, Portal and other puzzle type games that focus on thought provoking puzzles with a hint of timing. Misc : 11/12 achievements obtained through regular game play and 1 for competing a 45 minute speed-run (good luck!). ---------- Impressions and Review ---------- Braid is a beautiful and rewarding game that takes place in a watercolor world. The music is often somber and somewhat obscure for a video game, however it works beautifully in tying the story and the world together. Although short the game is a fantastic experience. The story comes in often non sequential bits and pieces and tends to be a bit dense, but it's undoubtedly worth the price of admission much like the art and music. For me personally the game really shines in its superb level design and transforming elements. Each world is constructed in a way that if so much as 1 ladder were in another spot or a single enemy crossed a path at another time the solutions would be completely different. By adding elements that transform and transcend time you'll never be left feeling like you know exactly what to do, but through a little trial and error solutions begin to show themselves until you can feel you've mastered them; at which point it's time to move on to something new. Everything about Braid is thoughtful, considerate and inviting. With just enough frustration to be completely rewarding, I actually feel sad that there isn't more. ---------- Final Thoughts ---------- I wish I would have bought several gift copies for friends (Now that it's on sale I will do just that!), Braid will go on my list as a must-own for Steam Gamers. -10/10 - You should already own this game.\n",

You’ll run around killing them with a mixture of clever traps and third person shooting but this tower defense game is really the story of the poor Orcs that you decimate. Every Orc’s story is told with a hallucinatory intensity, whether they were tossed off a cliff by a spring, slowed by tar before being perforated by poison arrows, burned to a crisp by ground based fire traps, or stabbed to death by the merciless protagonist. Orcs may not be real, but their trials and tribulations have taught me more about the fragility and splendor that we call life. I can’t express how transformative this masterpiece is. Let’s be clear, it’s not just a masterpiece of the tower defense genre, but of humanity itself. Orcs must die has turned me into a better person.

It's a game which won't disappoint even the most hard to please gamer, as It's packed with so much fun, humour, and thought. Orcs Must Die is more or less the same as Plants vs Zombies. It's a game where you must place traps in order to stop the horde of enemies from reaching their goal, and every new level brings a new trap. With every new trap of course brings a new enemy, so be prepared for this when organising your traps. Aswell as traps you can also use magic, and choose upgrades through-out the various levels through a card system. Being as this is the first game from Robot Entertainment, I give this game a big 10/10. There isn't many people who won't enjoy this game. It's pretty hard to find weak points. There's few bugs, has good graphics, and overall perfect gameplay. Pick this awesome game up at any opportunity. You won't regret it.\n",

That's the synopsis in a nut shell without giving too much away, the rest is orc slaying fun history. There's a variety of useful items including but not limited to 2 main weapons, 4 spells, 10 ground traps, 4 wall traps, 3 ceiling traps, 2 minions, and 3 All of those have various uses and abilities and it's all up to you as to how to best deploy them against the enemy. That's not even including the DLC. Weavers are simply menus with available upgrades you can purchase with cash earned from waves. You get a limit of which items you can use per mission, the max being 9 available slots. You are also able to upgrade traps when the time comes with 'skulls' earned after each victory. So it's somewhat tactical, you need to strategise your approach when starting a new map. It gives you a moment of grace to choose which traps to use and to scout the map. The music is upbeat and catchy, it compliments the protagonists witty commentary and the bloody orc slaying perfectly. I haven't encountered anything negative to say about it. The sounds effects are crisp and simple, nothing special of note here. The one sound that got on my nerves was the Autoballista firing sound, it's a loud WHOOOOSH and drives me nuts when I have a lot of them. Other than that, I don't mind the rest, it's very atmospheric. The sound that sent chills down my spine was the sound a flock of Fire Babies makes, it's very ominous. There's no endless mode, if you want an endless mode then get the second game. However, you can create a mod of the existing levels and add or modify waves. It's hands-on and takes patience and some planning on your part to do this, it's not an in-game feature. Pros:\n",

      "Original: I am currently taking classes to learn Russian (in my second semester), and this game is VERY helpful with vocabulary. What people need to understand is that there is no magic, effortless, lazy-oriented utility to help you learn all of a language. Language is very complicated and if you want to thoroughly learn one you need to put in a lot of effort to memorize and pound grammar (that is sometimes completely illogical at that) into your head. I really don't understand the notion from people that this game isn't worth it just because it only teaches vocabulary. Do they know that is the hardest part of a language? Vocabulary is endless hours of memorization and usage. With that being said, I will say that if you are actually trying to learn the language and not just doing this for fun or because you like memorization games (kinda like me, mainly why I'm learning a new language) this game is best used in conjunction with some self study of the grammar or a class to learn the grammar and boulster your confidence in the language. This game will SIGNIFICANTLY improve your usage of the language because vocabulary is key to being able to express yourself. Grammar is important, but if you use the wrong conjugation or maybe even tense because you are not quite fine tuned with the grammar most native speakers will still be able to understand you. All in all, I think this game is one of my favorite. There is so many languages you can learn. If you like memorization as much as I do (ALOT), like learning languages, and enjoy simple games, this is the game for you. I think this game is one of the best I have ever played.

If you like foreign languages and if you would like to do more than just play games on Steam; try this. Influent puts the fun back in to language learning, just as with 'Genki Japan'. I don't think that Influent is the only thing you need to learn a new language, and I speak 4 languages, but it does help alot to get started. And for this price, man, you can't go wrong.\n",

      "Original: Depending on the language you're learning, learning and retaining vocabulary may be the biggest part of learning a language. Especially if the language contains grammar you're already familiar with. This is essentially who Influent is for. Those wishing to learn vocabulary in a totally new and unique way. You play as just a teenager living in an apartment. You go through your apartment filled with HUNDREDS of items (seriously he may have a hoarding problem). You click on the object to view the word and you double click it to learn more about it (the pronunciation / noun / verb / gender of word, From a game standpoint, it's nothing special. The greatness of this game comes from the language learning aspect. I chose Latin as I have been learning Latin for the past few years so I can't really comment on native pronunciation (as it is a dead language). However, the pronunciation for the Latin course is definitely on par with every other course I have been through and a lot of work has evidently been put into making pronunciation amazing. You're paying essentially for a virtual world that makes learning vocabularly in another language EASY and FUN. These two things are the most important factors that lead me to believe anyone who buys and plays this will come out that much more knowledgable in their target language. I would recommend 'Influent' for mainly two types of people: 1. Those who have a good beginners / intermediate grasp in their target language and now wish to learn a lot more vocabulary 2. Those who just wish to dabble or have fun in a different language while still learning and retaining good information. I would not recommend this game to people who: 1. Wish to achieve fluency from this 2. Want anything more than a giant virtual dictionary I would also be wary buying this game if your target language uses a non-Latin alphabet and you have no knowledge in the language (Korean, Japanese, Mandarin). Reason being is that you are not taught how to read the alphabet of your chosen language. The first thing I would advise Japanese and Korean learners to do is to learn the alphabet first and it will be much easier later on. As for Chinese (Mandarin) learners, learn up on how Chinese characters are written (particularly radicals) before purchasing or delving in to this game. From a gaming standpoint is a ripoff for this game; however, it is intended as a LANGUAGE LEARNING program merely using a game as its platform. And for this game from a language standpoint is a REMARKABLE price. This is essentially the same principal as Rosetta Stone (learning vocabulary / phrases with no grammar or alphabet learning). I HIGHLY recommend this game.\n",

      "Original: Quite an okay game which will teach you basics of the chosen language in environment of house. However, it is not that fun if you don't know basics of the language or you don't actually plan to learn that language. If you are starting a new language and want to improve your vocabulary with few words, go ahead and buy it. If you are not interested in languages, don't consider buying it. Pros: Items that have multiple names are often listed after doubleclicking the item. Some of the items also provide verbs or adjectives related to them, not only the noun. Can enhance your vocabulary a little. Cons: Mastering the words is too repetetive, if you missclick an object, especially in a fridge, repeating all the words is then infinite. DLCs are too expensive considering it is just a simple translation of the game.

While this is a nice idea for immersive learning, and it's fairly well put together, it's really not the 'Language Learning Game' that it advertises as, because language learning is about so much more than vocabulary.

This game is great for helping you memorize the common words for common objects you might find around a household. I was playing for only about an hour and I could already walk around the apartment and 100% a time attack challenge for my first vocab list in Swedish. However it's not going to teach you a language. It doesn't teach you sentence structure or grammar, it doesn't explain inflections or even usage in a pre-built sentence. This game is purely a game of memory. See an item, learn the word for that item, with no additional context. It would be excellent for a person trying to sharpen up their vocabulary recollection on a language they're already at least partially familiar with, but as a tool for teaching you a whole new language it's absolutely not an option. Clearly a lot of hard work has gone into this game and hopefully it continues to receive updates to make it more useful, broaden the scope of its teaching and address some issues with spelling in some of the other language packs.

      "Original: Disclaimer: I have only played the German DLC of this game, and have not played any of the other DLCs, so I can only judge on the German DLC. This is a pretty good 'language learning' game, it does have some flaws, such as it not really helping with grammar or phrases, but it also is pretty useful as a vocabulary game. It's gameplay is a lacking, but it has some really good achievements. It has very humourous parts to it, as well as it's storyline. There are few language learning games on Steam, and to be fair, this isn't really much of a 'language learning' game, sure it's a good aid for learning language, but it doesn't ahve anything to do with grammar or phrases, more of a vocabulary game. Don't get this game if you expect it to teach you an entire language, to learn a language, it's best to have many different sources, and this is a very useful source, although it is nothing on it's own. If you have started learning a language and need help with vocabulary, it's good for you, or even if you have not learnt a spot of the language, it's an okay starting point, to help you get used to the language. The gameplay in this is limited, as you are locked in a house, and cannot escape. This is kind of a 'bottle episode' in that respect. You can go into first person and third person, you cannot jump, and you can open doors with the right mouse button (although the only door you can't open is the front door, believe me, I have tried), as well as being able to interact with other things. Being locked inside your house, with no indication of the passing of time, and with the only dislogue being you saying the names of objects to yourself, it makes it a pretty surreal game to play. You have to walk around and collect nouns, adjectives and verbs of your choosen language. There are quite a few words to collect, and it's half impossible to get them all, as there will always be something you miss. There are some pretty good achievements for this game as well, which is great incentive to learn more words. When you collect ten words you can do a quick quiz, where you can walk around while a word is on screen, and you need to find it in the room. The story of this excuses it to not teaching you about grammar or phrases. It is about a guy who made a device that tells you what an object's name is in another language, but the idea is pirated and patented by someone else, and you need to prove that you made the device, and only you know how the device works, so if you can collect 400 words and master them, then you can prove that you made the device. I don't know if anything happens after you collect all the words, as I have one word left, and I cannot find it, but I expect that it has a funny ending, either that or nothing happens, wither way, it's worth it. If you are learning a language or not I'd recommend this game, as it is a useful resource for learning a language, but it's also good if you're not learning one, as it never hurts to know more about other languages, it doesn't hurt to know other words for things in other languages. If you are learning a language I'd suggest you use other sites as well, such as Duolingo , Memrise or Babbel , but that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this game. This games helps very much to give you a visual, an audio and a written of the words.\n",
