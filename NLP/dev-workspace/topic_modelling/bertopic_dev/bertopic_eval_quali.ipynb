      "Original: This game is another title of the series 'Generic JRPG with no real value whatsoever'. Why? I'm so glad you asked, so let's find out, shall we? First off, the story is dull and uninteresting. It will provide you with no motivation to keep playing. And here's the next thing: Gameplay is just as bad. Don't get me wrong, I love JRPGs if they have been done well - especially if you can grind your chars to be very powerful against upcoming enemies, which feels good, just because you spent that much time doing it. But in this game it's like in The Last Remnant - enemies will always be leveled to match yours. I know there are people who like that but I do not. Also, the graphics and especially the animations are really, really bad. Oh, and the music does not even remotely match the scenery it's being played it.

      "Split: this game is another title of the series ' generic jrpg with no real value whatsoever '. why? i ' m so glad you asked, so let ' s find out, shall we? first off, the story is dull and uninteresting. it will provide you with no motivation to keep playing. and here ' s the next thing : gameplay is just as bad. don ' t get me wrong, i love jrpgs if they have been done well - especially if you can grind your chars to be very powerful against upcoming enemies, which feels good, just because you spent that much time doing it. but in this game it ' s like in the last remnant - enemies will always be leveled to match yours. i know there are people who like that but i do not. also, the graphics and especially the animations are really, really bad. oh, and the music does not even remotely match the scenery it ' s being played it. just listen to the battle music once and you will know what i mean. it ' s really sad as there are a few good things about this game as well - it definitely had potential. upgrading and level / skill - systems are great, controls work fine, loading times are non - existent and\n",

      "Original: I recommend this game to zombie game fans, but, for others, I am skeptical that you will be among those to like this game. I love this game, I really do, but, after taking a long break from it, I discovered why it got a little stale over prolonged periods of play. Like the Doom franchise, you have to get from Point A to Point B, but with objectives to do so in between to get there. That being said, the majority of the time, it's fun to panic with a team through zombie infested streets and tunnels. But, it gets old really fast over time as your progress through the same order of business over and over again. Not only does this get boring after this, but, the team play does not work with the gameplay if the team does not play like a team. It pains me to say it, but, some players can kill the experience and really mess things up for the others enjoying the game. It doesn't work all the time and, unfortunately, games like these could become rather stale without friends who know what they're actually doing during a mission. Also, what catches my eye is the lack of effort in terms of trying to push the genre further, regardless of if they actually wanted to or not. Gunplay, when ammo is available, is sort of satisfying, only when gunning down a horde of zombies with an M-16 is actually possible. Melee combat gets bloody, which is AWESOME, but suffers from very stressful moments where influence by your teammates can affect a good melee between you and a handful of zombies begging to be whacked. You get tired way too easily, which kills immersion when in fact in some situations you can do more than what you might expect of a regular average joe in a similar situation. The game loses immersion this way and really makes players a lot more vulnerable than planned in terms of gameplay mechanics. Also what is puzzling is also the lack of diverse missions with very different objectives. For example, almost every single Point A to Point B map, there is always one objective that pertains unlocking various amounts of doors. I expected something more than that from a game that is a lot more immersive than Left-4-Dead. Other objectives require retrieving items and fuel, grabbing keys, clearing exits, etc. It gets repetitive a lot and I find myself turned off by the repetitve nature of its escape game mode. But, there is a Survival game mode and that even gets stressful. What the creators didn't account for was the lack of proper teamplay that a small number of the player base display. I found myself always getting the scraps of supplies after many of my teammates bum rushed me and left me alone to fend for myself while everyone partied with shotgun shells, assault rifle rounds, and knives. I know, I should've left first, but, the moment that you hear that a supply drop arrives, you may not even get something worth the horrible trek from where you were, which could be on the OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP, or even just right next to the adjacent room where the drop arrives. Also, in this lack of effort argument is the lack of characters to choose. I have many female friends who have been turned off by this section only because of this, which, seems small, but, it isn't. I know they work so hard on this game, but the character selection in this game is severly limited. It ruins the immersion in the game, since it prevents players from completely immersing themselves in the universe of NMRiH. Immersion was the goal here and character customization sort of dropped its points. This game is fun when it can be. It can be intense, it can be scary and it sure can be addictive, but, when the other players allow it to or when the flawed game mechanics, repetitive play, sort-of drowned out immersion, or the lack of unique modes of play begin to show itself. I love this game, I really do, but, this game's flaws, mechanics, and lack of complete immersion take so many points from it where I can only recommend it to hardcore zombie gamers, zombie fans, or horror FPS fans. Sorry NMRiH, I have to say that I was disappointed, but, at least entertained. 64/100\n",

You will love Elizabeth, for she is one of the best, if not the best, NPC in games; it's far beyond your typical 'escort that usless person that will get kidnapped and doesn't do anything'. The only flaws I see in this game are some in-game things that just aren't consistent with the story and the context of the game. Some minor details that make you wonder if the developers didn't have enough time to review those little things, and just wanted to end the game quick. Some unrefined details that could make the game better. And it seems the game had much more potential; it could be not just a 10/10, but a 11/10. Enemies are fine, and are quite hard to kill, but there's no Big Daddy factor. There's no optional, OP guy, that makes you think if you want to risk ammo and health to kill, because you know it rewards you with some neat stuff. Handyman fights just seem too forced and aren't that enjoyable or difficult. Anyway, with that said, I would recommend this game, and give it a 8/10\n",

      "Original: This game plays out like a movie. If I saw it as a game, I would not recommend it as the gameplay is not something I would like to see copied. The side quests are their own nice little stories, but largely forgettable in the main story. I would recommend buying this game on sale and playing through the story mission. The enemies are absolutely terrifying and I shuttered every time I needed to come face to face with them, but were just another step to get me to the next plot point. Which was thankfully compelling enough to have me overlook continuity errors like how Ronan mannaged to get into the church when there were no doors opened for him. Somehow, I feel like the best experience from this game would come from following the main story step by step and not to stop for every little thing you find. In short, if you treat it more like a movie you will enjoy it more. There is little in the way of things you can miss that effect the outcome of the story in any way, but it was a nice change from Life is Strange where you end up feeling bad for saying hello to someone on the street for fear it might cause your best friend to be murdered later in the game.\n",

      "Original: Does this game have problems? yes it does. Does that mean it is not a good game? Absolutely not. This game is a blast to play with friends, and is still very exciting to play online with strangers. The game seems to be different every time because the killer runs off of instinct and every player is different causing the in-game scenarios to change. While the game is very unrealistic the people playing should understand that this is supposed to be like trying to survive in a horror movie. The game is full of adrenaline rushes and exciting moments. While there are many fun things about this game, there are also some negatives as well. Cons: -Finding a match at weird times of the day can be very difficult. -The game runs off of the killer's internet, meaning that the survivors have to deal with the killer's crappy connection. -Still a little buggy, with time that should change though. Definately buy this game if you have friends that are willing to play with you. The experience is significantly better if the survivors are talking to each other. Please don't base your opinion on this game based off of some of the morons who like to sabatoge their team while surviving. The game should get better over time, and hopefully they will switch over to dedicated servers. The time I have spent playing this game has come from one free to play weekend alone. I do not think I will pay full price for it, but I will definately pick it up when drops below $10.\n",

It's even a bit strange how nicely they was able to include complex Warhammer world things to simple rules and it works fluid and seamless like this would be only product this engine is used for.

      "Original: I've played since early Beta, and have seen this game evolve in ways no other game has. The characters have depth, the warframes and enemies have so much detail and design. There are four factions and plenty of side characters and organizations that started out as nothing more than reasons to go shoot things and get items. But over time all of these characters have been given more and more purpose and have been fleshed out so much that everyone feels interconnected. There is always something to do. There are dailies, weeklies, events, timed alerts that pop in and out, factions to gain reputation for, pvp/coop minigames, things to buy, things to make, things to level, mission types to run that vary not only by type but by the planet that mission type takes place on, Rank Up challenges, EXTENSIVE weapon/frame customization through appearance and Good lord the list goes on. This game does a horrible job at explaining things to even veterans of the game when new content comes out, let alone for new players. Some resources and missions have been left untouched (as if forgotten) for a long time. The game is often just grinding out missions for resources or blueprints to make new things. This game is not without its flaws. But as with everyone else who has stuck with Warframe for as long as I have, you can find plenty of things to do, and do them for a long, long time. And the grind becomes far more fun with a group of close friends to enjoy all the content with right beside you. Visuals - 10/10 Story - 8/10 Enjoyment - 9/10 Overall - 9/10, losing only one point to some of the odd development choices over time.

Annoying that I can't change crouch from toggle to hold or aim from hold to toggle as I usually play that way in most shooters. + All keys are rebindable and in general the menu settings are pretty good for a PC port, lots of nice options to optomise the game for your specific rig. + I found turning MSAA off, shadows down a little and volumetric lighting from 'ultra' to just 'on' helped the most with performance and framerate. Some people are saying this game is poorly optomized, but sometimes to get the best out of a game for your own personal rig you just need to fiddle about a bit, nothing more. + No lag or stutters, averaging 50-60fps, graphics look pretty nice. + Gameplay is along the lines of Human Revolution with a few improvements. + Make sure and download the Deus Ex Universe phone app and you'll get some cool bonus video content from the developers. - Had a couple of blips in audio but nothing major, just a half second or so twice during a cutscene. - Navigating menus can be a little slow and feels quite clunky. +/- When starting up the game the initial loading sequence can be a little long but anything after that isn't too bad. +/- Mouse sensitivity was a little weird, set mine to 13% which is crazy low but it seemed fine after that. So far seems like a really good game. ***WILL EDIT AND UPDATE ONCE GAME IS COMPLETED TO INCLUDE FULL STORY/GAMEPLAY REVIEW*** R9 200 series Gfx 8GB RAM AMD FX 8350 8-Core Processor at 4GHz 64-bit Windows 10 running at 1080p\n",

      "Original: So starting with the bad, this is a console port. It's so heavily obvious. - The textures are bland, very washed out. - Options are limited - Mouse sensitivity is soapy - Not the worst optimization, but far from good - Crashes a little less than 'often' The good: - Really fun and addictive game - Guns feel awesome (despite their flimsy sounds) - Stunning and unique abilities that few games manage to pull off (to be honest it still feels weird, but it feels like that's how it was meant to feel like) - Purely cheesy game, in a good way - Cutscenes are dramatic (cheesy dramatic) but still enough to engage you - Damn good level design - As a whole, most of the gameplay 'works' Overall, yes, I recommend this game, but that makes me almost generous. I'm so close to not recommending it (the demo doesn't even but the good about this game outweights the bad by a very TINY bit. Of course if you have access to an Xbox or PS2 with composite or some modded HDMI support, that's the best way you've got going for you to play this, in fact, stay far away from this console port if you've got those options. If not, the PC version is still fair enough.\n",

      "Original: VALUE: I'm a frugal gamer, and so value is one of my major concerns. I look games that provide a lot of content, but are offered at an affordable price. Far Cry 3 definitely delivers in volume of content, and being a 3 year old game, you can find it at a good price every once in a while. It gives you a large map to explore, with lots of secrets. Also, this game rewards explorers like me; the discovery of collectibles isn't only rewarded with achievements (which I don't care much about), but also with XP, which you can apply to a pretty cool skill tree that makes your character more resilient, mobile or deadly. STORY: The story is pretty stock: get revenge, rescue your pals-- and the theme is your typical 'white guy goes native and turns out to be the best of the best (see: Dances with Wolves, Tarzan, Avatar)' garbage but I really liked the voice acting, which is always competent, and sometimes excellent. The voice actors behind the characters Vaas and Dennis are the standouts. PERFORMANCE: I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't be able to play this on my PC, because I don't have a really powerful graphics card, but with my graphics settings at medium and rez At 1366x768, I get a frame rate that's definitely playable, and it still looks pretty. CONTROL: If you're a KbM player, don't be scared off by this console port. When it comes to first person games, I am a KbM player for the most part, but I decided to try playing Far Cry 3 with the controller, as was originally intended. There was definitely a learning curve with aiming with a stick, but it was quickly overcome. I still can't say that I'm really good at shooting with sticks, but it sure beats being hunched over a keyboard. Sometimes the contextual controls are a pain, because sometimes you have to wait for a prompt, but all in all, control is decent. DRM I've seen a lot of reviews complain about Uplay. Sure, setting it up was an inconvenience I could have done without, but it seems to be working well with the game, and it's playing nice with Steam. Just do what I did: install Uplay independently of Steam. This is one that you don't want to pass up; particularly if it's on sale.\n",

It does feel like a post-nuclear war world where humans have to suffer from radiation, lack of resources, and, most importantly and terribly, mutants born from the disaster. +Choice of weapons Every kind of weapons can be used throughout the game, and there's no 'best' weapon which can be used for all battles. You have to pick the right gun to fight against different kinds of enemies and different situation. +Good story Just as good as the novel. There are some changes and cuts here and there, but the awesome main story and background remains there. -Bad combat experience Human combat is generally average, fighting mutants is a horrible experience. The AI is horrible that sometimes you have no idea what the hell are your enemies doing with the walls and floors. And for most of the mutant combats you should have some Ai teammates with you, who have unlimited ammo, will never die (unless plot), high dmg output and some sort of taunt ability. You can't damage them (neither can the enemies), so you can happily hide behind him and throw grenade under his feet, kill all the enemies around and he won't take a scratch, -Intentional jumpscares which rather destroy the atmosphere I understand that this game is kind of a horror game if we consider its background but all the jumpscares in the game are basically just for the sake of scaring you. They'd put a shadow man in a daytime building when you're looting the place and have no idea why there appears this ghost for like 5 frames. Yes I'm scared but like why the heck do I have to deal with these things during looting or intense gun fighting? -Unbalanced secondary weapons As I mentioned your teammates take no dmg from your source at all. So you can throw knife, grenades, lightbangs, firebombs under their feet to clear out a huge wave of mutants (usually 4-5 which is really a lot). And, especially incendiary, is way too powerful in mutant combat. 3 incendiaries can just block the path and secure the position for some 20 seconds. 'Survival Game' seriously? -Excessive amount of resources I play in Ranger mode, and I've expected to be always out of ammo and other resources. Well the fact is, you hardly lack of anything unless you pour them like water in every fight. Almost all enemies can be dealt with within 2-3 shots by any gun (to the head I mean), and combat against humans usually means you can loot something after each kill. Yes you may not have enough ammo to literally pour on your enemies, but it’s always enough to secure a walkthrough. Well this may be newbie-friendly but I really don’t feel the pressure that it should give me in high difficulty.\n",

I stay hidden, too shocked to wipe off the blood. I regain my bearings and tell my other squad memeber that i will try to move to a building.

      "Original: English: This game its P2W, you just can't beat a player that spent real money (alot money, hundreds), everywhere has alot bots / cheaters, takes ALOT time to do anything, when you do you dont get anything good for you cuz its pure lucky, even to tame you will waste several hours/days to tame heroic ones and its pure lucky. Anything in this game its pure lucky. And also crashes alot and its poorly optimized, burns my notebook. And sure, the worst PvP Ive ever seen. Doesn't has Race x Race, Faction x Faction, Serv x Serv, neither arena (3x3, 5x5, 8x8 and or anything like that like WoW, GW2, RYL and Its simply big guilds hunting random ppl, and if you don't have a good guild will be 50 cowards vs you alone. And the biggest guild monopolizes everything in this game. Game turned from fun casual friendly experience into full blown korean MMO grind and P2W fest Korean game being korean game, like always, P2W, Pure Grind, Bugs and full of botters/cheaters. If I knew was a korean companny I havent started to play it. And Im sure this game will happens just like Aion, alot players and wype at first, but in 3~5 months everyone will stop to play because the game turned to pure grind / pay to win system. Português: Esse jogo é puro P2W, você não consegue derrotar um jogador que gastou dinheiro real, em todo lugar têm bot / cheaters, consome muito tempo para fazer qualquer coisa e quando faz não consegue nada bom, mesmo para capturar criaturas demora muito tempo (até dias), é pura sorte em tudo nesse jogo. E é muito mal otimizado, esquenta muito o meu notebook. E claro, é o pior PvP que eu vi, muito escroto. Não tem raça x raça, facção x facção, serv x serv, arena 2x2, 3x3, 8x8 e Como WoW, GW2 e É PvP random, simplesmente uma guild grande caçando pessoas aleatórias, e se você não tiver uma guild grande / boa vai ser sempre 50x1 pra cima de você. O jogo se transformou de um jogo casual divertido com experência amigável para um puro festival de P2W e grind korean MMO. Jogo koreano sendo jogo koreano, como sempre, P2W, Bugs, Pure Grind e lotado de hackers / cheaters. Se eu soubesse que fosse uma empresa coreana, eu não teria começado a jogar isso. E eu tenho certeza, que esse jogo vai ser igual ao Aion, com muito wype e jogadores jogando, mas, em 3~5 meses todo mundo vai parar de jogar.\n",
