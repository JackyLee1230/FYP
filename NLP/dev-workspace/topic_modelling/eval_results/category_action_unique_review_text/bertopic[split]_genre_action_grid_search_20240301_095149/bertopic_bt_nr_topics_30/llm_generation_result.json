          "9 / 10 i bought this game at a reduced price after reading some very good reviews. i was completely new to the franchise but picked up the game relatively quickly. at the time of wrting this reveiw i have completed the game with one of the three characters and i have just started a new story with a second character on veteran. the veteran option allows you to play the story mode from a level 30 character which was a really nice addition which provided a very different style of gameplay and more features, so it was as if you are getting two games for the price of one. however i was initally confused why i was only level 30 after completing the campaign on casual mode. gamplay functions as a normal rpg should. however i do stuggle with some aspects such as very small action bars ( 1 - 6 ) and the left mouse being responsible for movement and the primary attack which would send me running into a hoarde of enemies instead of attacking them. bosses are challenging and hoardes of enemies can take you down even on the easy settings. the tower defence, chimera and resistence side quests / activities / tasks are a nice aspect of the game which allow you to earn more money and experience whilst keeping you entertained.",
          "don ' t starve is a survival game that is amazing! overall the game is great, me and my mate are always down to play this game for hours and hours. the game isn ' t that easy to play but not that hard but its still fun. also theres like 11 - 10 characters you can play with ( wilson is my favorite ). so yea theres more but im just gona say is buy this game and play with friends. or buy the original game and play alone."

          "half - life 2 episode one is the continuation of the half - life saga or rather the story of how gordon freeman saved the world. while i was a big fan of the single - player campaign in the original half - life these new stories that have been unveiling beginning with with half - life 2 just haven ' t been quite as impressive and episode one feels much the same way. the story picks up shortly after the end of half - life 2 proper. through the power of being the protagonist you have somehow manged to survive and must now fight your way out of the city before it implodes on you. there is not much new to the storyline or gameplay and the areas feel like they could have been ripped straight out of the regular half - life 2 campaign. of course there is a certain bias from me because i never bought half - life 2 to play half - life 2, that was just a nice little bonus, i bought it for the mods and as such i am not nearly as invested as others in the lives of alyx and her boytoy gordon. get it if you liked the single - player campaign in half - life 2 and want a few more hours of it. otherwise you can safely ignore it as it ' s an entirely",
          "i would have to say that this is one of the best games in the call of duty franchise. i got this game on console a few years back and i ' ve had it on pc for a few years as well. the campaign is very fun and worth playing. it take about 6 - 7 hours to complete, but has some intense and epic moments, along with an amazing ending. the multiplayer is still very active. i don ' t play it much but there are many servers out there, most having friendly communitites. it is mainly tdm servers however, so there is a lack of variety. there are a good amount of high xp servers which you can play to rank up quickly, in order to get more weapon choices, perks and equipment. zombies is the primary reason myself and many others bought this game. waw on pc comes with all dlc free of charge, unlike the console version where you need to pay for dlc. the zombies maps that are avaiable are great fun to play on your own, but playing with friends makes the experience far better. the zombies experience does not end there though. you can download community created maps online and play them aswell. there are literally thousands of maps to choose from. if you"

          "the best batman game ever released, the graphics look so current that it blows my mind. it didn ' t have the best keyboard and mouse controls. you need a gamepad for this. overall, i give it out of 10",
          "first impressions ( pc ) : when you start the game it\u00b4s a bit confusing because the controls are initially keyboard, no mouse control to set gamma / graphics, make menu choices etc. when checking out controls in the options menu you\u00b4ll get a picture of an xbox - controller, with settings for each button, which is weird. no mouse controls in any menu. that seems to be the case throughout the game, only some menu - actions are done by mouse, the rest with keyboard ( or perhaps gamepad, in the game it is no problem controlling with mouse and keyboard though ( only some irritating hints telling you which stick on the gamepad to move, but not which mouse button to the intro is massive, about 1 hour. at first all you can do is move your head and look around as you wake up in a hospital in cyprus. you get to make your avatar, character, choosing face - style, hair, scars etc. the intro is about fleeing from the hospital, and it is very slow, i was aking to get on, but as usual in msg you are treated to elaborate dialogues about your history and this and that. it is a bit confusing at first when you have to change from sitting back, watching things play out,"

          "i could not find a single thing i liked about this game. the intro sequence runs at 15 fps despite being an fmv, the default controls are godawful, the character controls extremely poorly even after you modify the controls to make sense, the art style is off - putting, the dialogue is painfully bad, the music is bland and uninspired at best and grating at worst ( it is not possible to listen to the main menu music for any length of time ), but what made me stop playing was the tutorial. the game doesn ' t tell you what buttons to press to do anything and doesn ' t let you look at the controls unless you exit to the main menu, if any of the buttons work at all which they didn ' t my first time playing ; i had to exit to the main menu and open the tutorial agan before the game arbitrarily decided to let me use the movement keys. not to mention that it was extremely easy to render the tutorial outright unwinnable if you didn ' t know what controls did what ; i ran into this twice, first when i killed the first enemy from a distance instead of walking inside his hitbox and using an item that killed both of us, second when i",
          "this game is awesome! one of the best games i ' ve ever played! the story was really compelling, the graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is very satisfying. the only thing that i didn ' t like were the keyboard controls ; it was hard to remember them. fortunately, you can play this game with a controller, which i highly recommend. overall, it is a great experence for anyone who is looking for a third - person shooter on any platform."

( also, the music and the narrator both remind me of firefly, and zulf and zia are both cute. all the characters are cute. did i mention the great art style? ) the combat can be picked up pretty quickly, but mastering it - and the challenges for each weapon - are much harder. i ' d definitely recommend playing this game if you ' re looking for an unusual and creative experience.",

          "bastion is the proof that a game is a complex piece of art. the gameplay itself is not very complicate, you choose two weapons and a special power and go kill stuff. of course, bastion makes this gameplay flows beautifully and masters it. but it is still a simple comcept. what makes this so good is the art, the story and the soundtrack. maaaaaan, those are good. even the pos - apocalyptic world of bastion is beautiful with the art and colours used. the storyline is creative and surprises the player and is build by a wise narrator that gives the final touch of masterpiece to it. and the songs are touching and match the feeling of the moment perfectly. add it to a fairly long storyline and a good replay value and you have art. a very good one.",
          "note : for review with screenshots, please visit / bastion is the first title from supergiant games, and it \u2019 s an impressive first release. you play \u201c the kid \u201d, a young boy who wakes up after a terrible accident that has shattered the world. the kid then tries to rebuild the world, by going from city to city and collecting the needed pieces. gameplay - wise, bastion is a dungeoncrawler where you fight your way through set levels and enemies. it \u2019 s simple and straightforward ; right click for one type of attack, left click for another. you can also collect potions to be able to perform a limited amount of special attacks. there is no inventory system, but you can switch through weapons when you return to your base, to where you return after each finished level. i found the gameplay quite easy and it was a casual and relaxing experience. however, the greatness of this game doesn \u2019 t lie in the combat system : it lies in the beautiful audio, graphics and storytelling. bastion is a work of art. when you start the game, the first thing you will notice is the narrator. a sooth voice that tells the story about the kid as you are experiencing it. as you start walking, you will"
