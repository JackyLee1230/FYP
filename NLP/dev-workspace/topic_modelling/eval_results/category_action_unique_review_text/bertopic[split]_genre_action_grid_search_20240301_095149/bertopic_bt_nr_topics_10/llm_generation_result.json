          "great game it ' s just the best sonic game i ' ve played since sonic unleashed but i think the game was a little too short for a sonic game again best sonic game love it",
          "despite how the game auto scrolls on the act selection screen and during the level after you run it on the second time you play it i still enjoyed this game unlike other sonic games i enjoy its the first sonic game where you are able to equip certian abilities to a sonic. the point system gives this game more moral then the other sonic games. the new generation of sonic games are very entertaining and excting through sonic cd, sonic 3d blast and this game as well. i hope in later they ' ll bridge off and add more amazing ablitlites to sonic in the future. i gave it a 9 / 10. i ahve played sonic the hedgehog, sonic the hedgehog 2, sonic the hedgehog 3, sonic and knuckles, sonic advance, sonic advance 2, sonic advance 3, sonic pinball, sonic 3d blast, sonic cd, sonic generations."
