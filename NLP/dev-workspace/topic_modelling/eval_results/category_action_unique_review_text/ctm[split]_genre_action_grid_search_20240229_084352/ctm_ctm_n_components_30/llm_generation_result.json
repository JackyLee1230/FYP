          "this game has so much promise but doesn ' t deliver. you, and others of the first company, assault the space hulk via boarding torpedoes. what happens when the torps impact and you ' re ready to rush in and board? nothing. the game cuts to a briefing screen that you can ' t skip. you have to wait until the whole wall of text has been slowly read to you. then you click proceed, and you proceed with boarding the space which is empty. i know they intended to delay the action to make it more atomospheric, but they really built up the boarding sequence and it was very anticlimactic. then you wander around for a little bit, chasing a blip on the map while you repeatedly encounter doors that you try to open but they refuse, just to make you wander around the combat - free hallways a bit more. the environments are gorgeous, but there isn ' t even spooky music going on to set the mood. after some more wandering, the first combat happens, getting surrounded as expected. except the enemies did something to completely obscure my view, so i ' m spinning around and swinging my sword i get a very brief flash of unclouded vision, and then the game cuts to a death",
          "surprisingly enjoyable game so far, it is impressive how a game that was made more than 10 years ago it still prevails as an incredible hidden gem out there. the game begins with you getting a pitchfork as your main ' melee ' weapon in order to defeat a bunch of undead zombies that crumble from their graves, as you progress you get sticks of dinamite wich serve to murder higher ranking armies of hell such as monks or demons that spit poisonous gue from their stomach, all of this being presented througout a well thought scary and unique setting, sometimes you can be in a carnival, while other times you could be around a sinked ship in cracks of icebergs. the weapons are extremely unique too as i expresed before, the gunplay just clicks making each shot satisfying, i cannot really name what is it about it, maybe i could come close to express it as the mixture between the sound and the graphics as blood pours from you ' re enemies chest flying across and around you. overall it ' s truly one of the most enjoyable ' fps ' from the nineties that i ' ve ever played, thank god i can play it here again, considering there has been just way too long for me to play through such"

          "suddenly becomes very dull, which is a shame. also, there is no chapter 3, which is standard in mgs games as fas as i ' ve heard. the story should have been elongated anyway in my opinion, but that ' s personal. - side ops become very repetitive after a while. i discovered this after doing like the 15th ' destroy the armored vehicle ' mission. in my eyes, the amount of side ops should have been tuned down, or a more varying roster containing completely new objectives could have been implemented. - fobs are a fun idea, but need reworking. i was never encouraged to infiltrate another player ' s fob, out of fear of retaliation and losing all my valuable resources. events are a thing, but the same platforms with the same guys which follow the same movement patterns every time does not make for an experience you ' ll enjoy for a long time. - various mechanics are unexplained, which is confusing. elements like demon points, staff morale and security planning are not properly described and in case of the latter two are poorly implemented, which makes the game feel rushed ( which it is, as you ' ll discover in chapter 2 ). overall, mgsv is an excellent game and although it '",
