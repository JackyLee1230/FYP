["This game is a kinetic visual novel with a shallow linear story. Artistic 'fanservice' hampers the development of a richer plot, however the iconic general art style of the sakura series of games is solid, and the UI is strong as well. Plot devices are well placed for quick feels (the solely metaphoric type) and I found no significant qualms with the game overall, which is uncommon :)"

["A decent enough casual game where the aim is to fire your balls at the approaching board so that you match three or more of the same colour ball, which causes any now unattached balls to fall off as well. The idea is to clear the board in as few moves as possible, but also against the clock - or rather the board, which moves down steadily (or fast if you haven't made any matches for a few seconds).  There is an upgrade mechanism to give you skills you can use to get through awkward sections of the board, which rewards playing well in earlier rounds and getting low scores - you can get up to three upgrade points per board cleared, or as few as one if you take lots of shots to win. There is also some physics you can take advantage of (or get scuppered by), if a group of balls is only connected by one ball they will hang loose and swing around, sometimes banging into other groups, which can cause a chain reaction - or block off an area you wanted to be able to fire at next.  Overall it is a decent enough game to play through if you like this sort of thing, don't expect anything new after the first level - each group of levels just adds another row of balls to clear, and each new zone adds one more colour to the mix to make things harder (but resets the depth of the game board to be much shorter again at first)"
 "Interesting 'story', game had such high potential, but lacks execution. You would expect the challenges to be 'think before you leap and you can win' but 99% of them are 'start the mission over because in the last roll you got a 5 instead of a 6'. The dice part is interesting but I don't think that the tasks are balanced enough in order to make the game fair. TL;DR - Roll &lt;5 lose - Roll 6 win sometiems"]
