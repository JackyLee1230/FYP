          "shan gui is a fairly short kinetic chinese visual novel. kinetic meaning linear story and if there are choices they will have little to no effect on the final outcome. the story as a whole is rather sweet and whimsical, the music is well done and fits the journey, and the background art can be breathtaking at times. the character / sprite art on the other hand, while well done, isn ' t really to my taste though it doesn ' t detract from the experience as a whole. if there are any downsides to the game they would have to be the quality of the limited voice acting and the english translation. personally i didn ' t find either of them to be a big issue, but for the sake of full disclosure it should be mentioned. the translation itself does the job it needs to, i don ' t feel at any point something important was lost as a result, but the wording used can be very awkward at times. as for the voice acting, the actors didn ' t do a bad job, the sound quality just seemed rather poor, which is strange considering the quality of the music. once again, not a big issue for me though. i honestly think one of the more interesting things this visual novel does is",
