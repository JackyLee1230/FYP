          "I don't like puzzle games. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I bought this game because it's a business management simulator. Thing is, the business management part is only half of it, if that. The restf is very much a puzzle game, but not one that requires you to go so in depth with your puzzle solving thinking that you end up with a migraine. When playing Big Pharma, you'll notice that most of your time is spent, with the game paused, trying to fit equipment into spaces that make it work well with other equipment, within the constraints of the sometimes awkwardly shaped space provided. Sometimes you'll find yourself thinking 'Geez, they must have made this chain of machines incompatible with this dumb building on purpose', while at other times you'll think 'Wow, this fits so perfectly here, without wasting any space at all, that I must be doing something right!' Odds are pretty good that the reality is somewhere in the middle, where there wasn't much thought put into it at all aside from using the shapes of the buildings to throttle the difficulty. You will be annoyed at the lack of space, irritated with the AI for seeming to be able to patent something just as you're ramping up to produce it, but overall, you will get a sense of strange euphoria, seeing your machinations chug along, making you lots of money -- and it is pretty darn easy to make lots of money in this game. That part isn't hard. The difficulty definitely comes from making the pieces fit in a way that accomplishes your goals, effeciently and on timie, without blocking you from making the next line. This is a great game to play with the background music turned off and your favorite tunes playing instead. That's not to say that the background music is bad. It's just mediocre, and mostly pointless. The graphics look exactly like they should for a game such as this -- good enough. They're not realistic but they're not so cartoony as to be a distraction from the puzzle aspects. There is no story or campaign or anything. The closest you get is the 'challenges' screen, which is the first thing you see when you click 'New Game', and offers various scenarios with challenges attached. There is a tutorial which is both easy to use and fairly comprehensive, though you'll probably have to Google some of the higher tier equipment to see how they work. The information is not hard to find, though, so that's not really a downside. Overall, Big Pharma is a pretty good game. The simplicity will draw you in and keep you hooked even well past the point where you're tired of doing the same things over and over again and, really, that's its biggest rub -- redundancy. From the moment you play the first game in the 'Beginner' column to the moment you put it away, you're doing pretty much the same thing over and over again. Think about it as an assembly line simulation tied in with some simplified business management concepts and you've got a good idea of what Big Pharma is all about. You're simply placing machines in a way that will be as efficient as you can make them. Everything else is just details. Is that a bad thing? In this case, I don't think it is. To me, the repitition gave me a sense of comfort, knowing that, at the beginning of every scenario, I had at least some *idea* of what I was doing. The first level drugs are extremely easy to make, and they get you off the ground pretty quickly, though you are forced to get more complicated since you'll oversaturate the market with them if you just make those. It was when the idea of starting fresh became significantly more appealing than continuing to try and get Master Level of accomplishment at a scenario that I realized it was probably time to play something else. However, that was 80 hours in, which is not a bad return for a game that costs $25 when it's not on sale! I'll probably go back to it at some point, too."

          "I will be mostly polite about this first; the art was very impressive and the story was good enough to hold my attention however long I played that. I wasn't really keeping track. However after that this is pathetic soft-core wank material. Nothing more. Am I guilty of finding cartoon women attractive? Yes. Do I get off on hentai? Yes. Am I ashamed of this? A good ammount of the time. However this game was missing one of two things to be a ringer; my preferred desire would be a deep and desirable world with an ending that pays off. Yeah the premise kept my attention and the art was superb (I can't stress that enough, it is this games strong suit) nothing really happened at all with that entire experience. I can sum up the game for you very simply, right here, right now.pin up Sure the characters were nice to look at, and they started with interesting stories and had interesting personalities; but the ending screwed it all up. There was no pay off for being teased by these characters for hours, you don't really get to 'choose' anyone to be with at the end. The only choice in the entire experience isn't even worth replaying for as it only changes the festival scene for sure and MAYBE the end (I'm not replaying this so I can not gurantee even that's true). And to top it all off it kept hinting at a sequel 'Takahiro's adventure isn't over I really don't want to play through another afternoon waster just to get the pay off that should have been in this game. If you had taken the time just do four fair endings this would have bumped up from a disappointing experience to at least an acceptable one. Because like I said if this is to build up to with the same just to get the pay off there, you are not getting my money for that. Heck to the naw. I know you probably will get some money off them so long as you feed upon the simplistic weeaboos who don't just find much less tame stuff FOR FREE. But if you respect yourself as artists; give the reader a little prize for making it through your story. Give them choices, give them pay off, give them freaking depth over 'hey look at this cute girl talking to you and her BEWBS' give them something to go off of. Otherwise you're just wasting everyones time. And you know if you're going to feed to the lowest common denominator anyway, to people who really don't give two turds and a corncob about plot and development and depth. At least give them full on porn. Like I said, you can find way better than mostly naked boob for totally free. So yeah; more depth and intrigue or a lot more nudity one way or the or both, can't complain to both I suppose. I will give you the benefit of the doubt, maybe it's an early attempt (which kudos if-so) or if there's a time limit I dunno. To prospective buyers; if you want an easy time waster and nothing too complex for your young minds. This is an okay buy. If you're looking for something mind blowing that you can read and wank to whenever you want; you can find better stuff for free. And frankly what feels like a dating-sim that doesn't let you, you know, get with a girl at the end; romantically or sexually. That is a huge glaring error that should not have been a thing. I pray this was helpful to someone or at least gave anyone who's like me a chance to nod and say 'finally someone makes ",
          "How dare she say that Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon is terrible? Oh, she's so wrong! Well, apart from Clara is a really well-written protagonist. This game is an interactive story, wich is partly funny and mostly sad. There's not much to do than to follow the story and walk around. But that's not a bad thing, as the story is interesting and immersive. The music is unique and standard music from the RPG Maker VX Ace is only used barely, but in fitting scenes. Now the graphics are kind of mediocre. The mapping is okay, but some paths could have been shorter- or at least there could be a running function. In the end it was a short, but worthwhile and kind of depressing experience. I think I wouldn't have bought it for the full price, but in Sale it was definitely worth it."

          "Waste of your time. Endless mode is boring as hell and there is no real end-game goal besides making your char even more ridiculous. You will have unlocked every skill after 5 minutes and from then on there is no change in playstyle. You can't change skills, you will need to level another char. This is not replayvalue, it is a time-sink. There is no synergy between the towers and abilities and the amount of towers and traps which can be placed is laughably low. If you enjoy passive gameplay and have a lot of time to spare (and got 2-3 friends who've got the same problem) then I would recommend you this. However, if you cherish satisfying slaughter of hordes of enemies, interesting levels and fewer limitations on how to equip your character and do the levels, I strongly recommend Orcs Must Die 2. Even without a loot-system, it offers more flexibility, more char customisation and more ways to beat the various levels (which are ten times more varied than these). 3/10 would not buy again."

          "This is a nostalgia post. I remember 12+ years ago when this game was still being updated. If this game had a counter for how many hours I spent playing the game and tinkering with the various mods of the days it would be at least 40+. I remember after playing it I searched for other games with the same kind of setup and did not really find any as these types were not that common back then. Survival (eating, fighting, exploring) Crafting Multiple endings It is highly moddable (Just go to the games Data folder, copy the Default to a new folder name, open any file with a text editor, everything is commented, however the syntax is different from most other games, and slightly confusing to relate 2 entries ) A built in level editor There was not that many mods for this game as it was definitely an overlooked game of its time 4 different classes to play as (more with mods) that each have their distinct requirements to live and flourish Human - The generic class Android - Lives on batteries Alien - Who wants an army of swarming mindless peons Psion - Way different route then the rest 3 Difficulty levels Wimp - Walk in the park status (no temp, no weather effects, needs drop slower) Normal - Temperature and weather effect you Hard - I've never really played on this so no opinion This game was built on the same renderer (and maybe game engine) as the pre-steam Crimson Land Low system requirements I know it can run on XP, but it also runs on windows 7 / 8 with no modifications (in my experience) I bought this out of pure nostalgia",

The controls are the basic, run and jump style, with some powers ups thrown in from activating platforms, extra height and wall climbing. It may look simple but it's really challening, espicially when you're trying to get 100%. The graphics are like something out of the olden days of PC gaming, with no music and only the sounds of bleeps and bloops. Think of this as more like the game Adventure on Atari 2600, mixed in with the map layout of Metroidvania, and you've got yourself a fun and challenging game that is surprisingly free to play.",

Someone died, they're alive later). The story was an interesting idea, most of the conversations with characters were pretty great and well written, however some conversations and story points made me go wtf, didn't make sense, or was just badly thought out and written. I like the changing settings and how there were at least 3 full towns to explore, however lacking towards the end in SV. Now as a choose your adventure/choice game I would recommend it hesitantly. BUT absolute worst thing this game does is create a very long amount of trash filler minigames to tie the story together. From my playthrough I played 3 arcade minigames (one pacman ripoff), 2 job minigames (Tofu/Weed jobs), coat check minigame, box minigame, hacking minigame (frogger ripoff), vent maze, deliver drugs minigame, boxing minigame, 4 casino minigames. I hated them. Almost all the minigames I listed are required for progress or jobs done to progress the day. By the end of the game, I've had enough and didn't even play any of the casino minigames cause that's a stupid idea. I hated those boring minigame segments that are half the game. Also, the developer cameo was great at first in the coffee shop, but wtf was with the two of them, and that ending at the book store was so stupidly bad I laughed. Do not recommend."

          "I first bought the game on my android device. It was very fun and challenging. Afterwards I went to the store page on Steam, and inserted the name into the search bar. I then bought the game and played it for a while. I noticed right away that it was easier played with a controller, but was still easy with keyboard controls. The game is about controlling a small cube around a auto-scrolling level while music plays in the background to aid you in jumping. The game becomes progresively harder after each lever, and with the online levels, created by other users, there is endless gameplay. Overall I rate this game a 8/10",

My first game I sailed north off of the edge of the world, but time started to freeze so I turned around. I arrived at a chapel covered in candles and filled with cannibals, so I left before they decided to eat me. I ended up overthrowing a few empires, stole a zeppelin, and flew away to join the once-god of sacrifice and endings. My younger brother joined a cult worshiping a machine-god before going insane and sinking his ship by flooding it with blood.",

Ok I know VR visuals look more like an N64 than we would want but come on and suspend your disbelief and have some fun. I jumped at the chance at trying this interactive learning experience. Instead After a few hours exploring Im dissapointed at how terriblely badly the scanning system, which is the core 'game play' mechanic in Time Machine VR has been implimented. Points deducted for a very hit and miss programming which ends up turning an experience that should be magical into a frustrating one. After the 10th time trying to capture the feeding behaviour of a massive beast that I was clearly seeing but for some (unexplained) reason Time Machine VR was telling me I wasnt capturing had me exiting in frustration. Couple this with every gamers dread, the unskippable exposition scene! and I was wondering if A, had these guys played a game before never mind developing one and B why these eye rollingly rudimentary problems are following us into the brave new world of VR and stinking it up like 200 tons for rotting dino-fish. Not polished enough to recommend but nice models and animations are worth seeing, just not at this price so just try the demo instead. *Update* Now tested on Vive and has horrible graphical latency, conclusion: AVOID"

          "OK, KM2KDB long name, is really an odd one. It has all these great elements, but still needs to be polished a bit more. They claimed to have controller support where it did, It took me nearly 30mins getting it to work, and for somereason the controls can go unresponsive right before a match, but kick in a sec in. But by far the worst thing is my AnitVirus freaks out on the file. I'm pretty sure its a false positive but still, having a game you purchase on steam that does that is a bit unsettling. It just feels slitly sluggish during menus and small moments. Now the Fighting amazing, I have a great time ever fight sometimes I get a but confused on i get 1 shot but still the fighting can and is very enjoyable. Besides the bugs etc, the only thing i feel is a bit meh. Is how the level and training system is. You get 3 training options at the start of the game, and that is great. Once you use those 3 you wont get to see another til after you beat a event ( which sounds alright but) This is where it gets to the grind, they are op for a good 2 3 trys, and you do gain some ablity after but doesn't feel fun in that way. And until you get money and fame your kinda stuck doing the same and omg please get rid of the work mini game worst mini game ever. I hate SOOO BORING Can't reccomend it @ its current price, find it for a $1 sure, but still. Wish it wasn't so MEH fighting feels so fun!!",

          "One of the first games in a long time that gave me the classic 'one more run' syndrome. This game is a near perfect mix of Nuclear Throne and the Binding of Isaac, giving you that item hungry feel while not relying on items to the point of frustration. Though the default guns are rather lacking and you can get some what screwed over on the first floor thanks to the RNG it's still a fantastic game and more than worth the price. The number of different items in this game is unimagenable, ranging from pillows to coffee. Odds are you will find something to suit your playstyle. Some of the down sides being the lack of online co-op and the staleness of the default guns are easily overcome by the sheer replayability and well polished gameplay mechanics. So over all this game is getting a solid from me. The only required improvements in my opinion is the addition of online co-op and a way to guarantee a different gun on the first a a wheel-of-fortune style gun selection screen at the start or something?) So what are you doing reading this? Buy it already and have some fun!"

You like levelling a character, but sometimes just long for the freedom of the old days - when levelling meant going up in health and maybe getting new gear? Perfect. I have the best game for you. There's always something new to explore and see. Randomly generated worlds offer variation while allowing for familiarity with the mechanics as you progress. Your characters can easily move from world to world, without having to even open their last one. You can even have one world that you slowly tear apart to acquire the materials to build your dream home on the second one. You can create machines, host a capture the gem competition between yourself and a dozen close friends, or battle giant flying skulls with arms, aliens, a wall made of flesh, or spiders bigger than your head. You can make armor out of gold, bone, or mythical metals. You can fly a giant drill that uses lasers to tear up the ground in wide swathes. You can build a city full of merchant's shops and homes for those aforementioned capture the gem friends. You can make giant billboards, a computer, or death traps for when the Blood Moon rises and the zombies come to eat your You can dye your hair a literally sparkling purple. You can build a tree for the holidays. You can wear an umbrella on your head or dress like a wood nymph. And so many housing styles - dungeon, wood, ice, marble, the list goes on. Seriously, I could keep going on about this game for What? Stop? Never. Well, fine. But, only because I'm going to go play the game now. 10/10"

I didn't really have to learn how to dodge most attacks. Often it came down to just spamming attacks with the most effective weapon and hoping the enemies died before you did.

Multiplayer is awesome, because there is also PVP option. And also, very good price! Buy it, you won't regret it.",
          "It is a simple point & click game, but in a slightly different way. You are actually reading a pop-up book and you can drag and slide parts of it. There are also a few puzzles in the game, so you can continue your journey. The puzzles are not very hard. But if you need help you can ask for hints, who are still slightly cryptic. There is not a lot of text, only a few haiku's at the end of every level. But it has definitely a good storyline, which doesn't even need words to explain it. The gameplay is not long, there are 3 levels to complete. It took me 1,5 hours to complete the game. The watercolour graphics caught my eye. And gosh, the game is so pretty! The music is completing this atmosphere. The only negative thing is that the music suddenly cuts off at some points. Or that it suddenly switches to a different song or sound. I would recommend this game if you are into slow paced, but beautiful games. Of course it is not long, but it is worth the time. My rating for this game: 7/10"

          "Liked it a lot but I felt the map was too big and the controls a bit cluttered. Double-tapping to dash sucked. Found myself running slowly through long corridors a lot. A more compact map or faster movement options would have been nice. I feel like most of the combat was centered around finding a cheap strategy or safe spot, especially on a lot of the bosses. I didn't really have to learn how to dodge most attacks. Often it came down to just spamming attacks with the most effective weapon and hoping the enemies died before you did. Good game overall though. The music was catchy and creepy, and the graphics very alien-looking, just what I'd want from a game like this."

          "This is a sleek and fun first person puzzle platformer that executes a couple good orignial ideas well without bloating itself by getting overly long and tedious. Basically, you use 'rifts' to travel between parallel rooms, which can be differentiated by the monochromatic background (white or black). The rifts will be in the same place in both rooms, but nothing else necessarily will be. The puzzles are primarily based on orienting the rifts properly to over obstacles and reach switches to eventually make it to the exit. It starts off very simple and the difficulty builds in a very natural way. At the end I definitely felt challeneged, but never so much so that I wanted to stop playing. Eventually you are required to use platforms that manipulate gravity, which where the game really shines and will put your spatial reasoning to the test. The aesthetic may not be for everyone (I personally loved it) and there's no plot to speak of, so if you're for anything besides puzzles you might want to keep looking. Otherwise this game provides a fascinating and unique take on the genre of first person puzzlers. The 'perfect' number of moves also provides an extra challenge that I found engaging in most instances."

The graphics are decent and it is the kind of game you can just play 10 or 20 minutes before bed to relax. The music is solid for the setting. It's easy to learn and get into. There's 9 different weapons, 6 stats you can raise, and the plot isn't bad. Without grinding, you could probably beat the game in a few hours. I leveled up more than necessary to get more of the achievements, ended up beating the game at level 26 but you can beat it much earlier than that. There's 24 achievements that are pretty easy to get and random drops. I was able to 100% the game in hours. The last few drops can be tedious but otherwise it's pretty fun overall.

          "Sentris is definitely worth looking into if you have any interest in creating music. It reminds me of my days playing with software such as FruityLoops, but puts its own unique spin on things. I\u2019ve enjoyed playing through the provided songs and am starting to create my own unique setups (as well as attempting to emulate some more widely-known music too). 'What is Sentris in 2 Minutes?' Video: /?id=502221656 Overall the game is a lot of fun, and quite a versatile tool once you get to grips with it. That said, there are a few features I would love to see implemented going forward. Primarily these are just additional expansions for added versatility when creating songs. It would be great to be able to select notes outside the standard scale that I choose, and to apply effects (such as reverb or echo) to specific instruments during remix. Nevertheless, the initial offering (at time of official launch) is a joy to play around with. When you hit upon a riff that catches your ear and develop it into something you love, it really brings a smile to your face. Whether you're smashing notes together until something sticks (or doesn't!) or meticulously crafting a pre-meditated loop from scratch, Sentris is really unique and wonderful take on musical creativity.",

          "Terrible game. Tight spaces with lots of large enemies and weapons that don't work well and don't do much damage makes this game hard. And not in the fun way. The models are aweful, the effects are annoying, the music is generic. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",

          "Sentris is definitely worth looking into if you have any interest in creating music. It reminds me of my days playing with software such as FruityLoops, but puts its own unique spin on things. I\u2019ve enjoyed playing through the provided songs and am starting to create my own unique setups (as well as attempting to emulate some more widely-known music too). 'What is Sentris in 2 Minutes?' Video: /?id=502221656 Overall the game is a lot of fun, and quite a versatile tool once you get to grips with it. That said, there are a few features I would love to see implemented going forward. Primarily these are just additional expansions for added versatility when creating songs. It would be great to be able to select notes outside the standard scale that I choose, and to apply effects (such as reverb or echo) to specific instruments during remix. Nevertheless, the initial offering (at time of official launch) is a joy to play around with. When you hit upon a riff that catches your ear and develop it into something you love, it really brings a smile to your face. Whether you're smashing notes together until something sticks (or doesn't!) or meticulously crafting a pre-meditated loop from scratch, Sentris is really unique and wonderful take on musical creativity."
