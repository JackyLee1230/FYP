          "played the demo and definitely worth getting the game, i am not a huge fan of visual novels, i find them to get boring really quickly with too much reading and too much non relevant content. this one is fantastic, the music is well composed and changes in all the right places, the voices are too cute and just perfectly placed for each character. the storyline is more voiced with little extra descriptive text which is think is great. ui is clean and put together nicely. price is really cheap at i would probably buy it even if it was a bit more. also the animations are great, they add so much life to the characters and keep you from dying of the boredom involved in clicking through static content of 2 - 4 lines of text. best visual novel type game i have played by far i would recommend it to anyone who likes these types of games and if you dont like them but your an anime fan who loves cute things then definitely do youself a favor and grab this, support the developers they really did a great job and they are not even charging that much for it. will definitely be getting the second volumn when its out, keep up the great work. pro ' s great voice acting animated characters music awesome intro quick and clean ui con"

          "this is a good game, and a great party game if you have 2 or more players ( best with 4 ) there are a lot of people who play ' the yawhg ' a few times through and say that it is pretty monotonous. my statement to them is that they are probably monotonous in their play style. if you play this game trying to maximize your character, it turns into a boring game quickly. this is a game for adventurousness and sometimes crazy play styles will actually make a much more successful and interesting ending. those who played the game through 3 times are judging a game almost by the tutorial. you need to play quite a few times to see some of the interesting random occurances play out that make the game really fun."

          "don ' t play this ' game ', nor should you view it as an accurate depiction of depression. you don ' t make the choices in the game, instead, the developer has already crossed off certain options in order to force you down the same bad ending. depression quest only tries to show the worst case scenario for depression, not at all acknowledging that it is treatable by the choices you make, instead, it portrays the only way to treat depression is with pills and a therapist. notice how i said ' tries ', because even then everyone in the ' game ' acts like a complete idiot around the player. accuracy aside, this is just a poor excuse for a ' game '. from the static overlay constantly on the screen in a pathetic attempt to make the mediocre story seem ' deep ' to the lack of multiple endings with your choices basically doing nothing, there ' s a reason this game ' s top reviews are mostly negative."

          "default, the player can rewind time in each world, but each world has its own special mechanics that also deal with time. the player has to solve puzzles using this time mechanic, often with some precision platforming. each of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, but the levels are designed such that the player can walk past a puzzle to solve it later. some of the level designs are repeated in this game, but with new twists to be used with a new time based mechanic. the time based mechanics of braid are amazing for solving the tricky puzzles while also being cool yet confusing when thinking about how some of the mechanics work. although some of the puzzles can be a pain to figure out or time well with precise actions, braid tends to be a short game at 5 hours, and maybe more if players are really stuck on some puzzles. braid has its strong and unique puzzle gameplay while having good design and a story to think about. while the puzzles may be hard at times and the story a bit strange, this is a great indie title to check out and play for the different things it brings in the game.",
