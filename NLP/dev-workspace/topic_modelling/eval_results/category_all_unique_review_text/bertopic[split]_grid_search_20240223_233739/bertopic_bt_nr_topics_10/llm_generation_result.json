          "does this game have problems? yes it does. does that mean it is not a good game? absolutely not. this game is a blast to play with friends, and is still very exciting to play online with strangers. the game seems to be different every time because the killer runs off of instinct and every player is different causing the in - game scenarios to change. while the game is very unrealistic the people playing should understand that this is supposed to be like trying to survive in a horror movie. the game is full of adrenaline rushes and exciting moments. while there are many fun things about this game, there are also some negatives as well. cons : - finding a match at weird times of the day can be very difficult. - the game runs off of the killer ' s internet, meaning that the survivors have to deal with the killer ' s crappy connection. - still a little buggy, with time that should change though. definately buy this game if you have friends that are willing to play with you. the experience is significantly better if the survivors are talking to each other. please don ' t base your opinion on this game based off of some of the morons who like to sabatoge their team while surviving. the game",
          "good stuff about this game this is super fun game as you can play mini games and also play a story of challenges you get characters and you can get weapons for yourself its also really easy to play multiplayer with friends and also it will make you laugh so super much, also i really enjoy making levels to play its super easy super fun and a really nice thing to make the game way more fun. here are some bad things about the game i have noticed that this game doesn \u2019 t have a lot of people making servers so when i went on today there were only 2 servers so that is kind of a bum because i like playing the game modes with online people, i \u2019 m not sure how to get gems in the level maker so idk if i \u2019 m missing something or its right under my nose, glitches here and there but i still love this game. i would totally recommend this game its super fun and so many things to do"
