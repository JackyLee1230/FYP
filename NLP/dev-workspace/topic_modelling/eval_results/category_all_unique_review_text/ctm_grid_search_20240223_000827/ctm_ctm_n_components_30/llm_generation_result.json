          " there's certainly a lot to be said of this game. It does amaziingly in the story department, keeping you on the same general path, while you still have the ability to drastically affect the story and characters, the characters are quirky and deep and each one has a certain appeal to them. The gameplay is challenging, however if you are genocidal the battles require a lot less thought, but it's still fun to play. The soundtrack however was one of the highlights, and really set the tone for a great many battles and areas, and the absense of music leaves a kind of empty feeling which is used really well. let's what what Oh right! There is a huge amount of intrigue apart from the central storyline, almost every enemy you see will be deeper than, 'OOOOOOOOooOOO0ooOO He looks tough!!!' there's a backstory to almost everything. Overall the game was a 10/10 for me. Also #Temmy."

You can also discover music while picking a track in the featured songs. However, I haven't really found any music I really like in featured. I think it'd be necessary to add an option to find music via Soundcloud based on the music you seem to like playing. The actual gameplay is just a cool as Audiosurf, and it's a little smoother, at least for me. The other gamemodes are fun as well, but basic Mono and Casual satisfy just as much anyway. Although Audiosurf 2 brought in new stadiums, Classic stadium is still the best. The music is a lot more enjoyable in Classic, and in Mono mode. Any music fits in Classic stadium, which is nice for me. If you like music in a sense more than listening, and want to have some fun with it, then this game is for you. If you just want to ride the tracks with your music and don't really want any extra stadiums or gamemodes, get Audiosurf. If you like multiple gamemodes and stadiums, then get this one.

Well that's what I thought about the story of Skull Girls. Beyond the gameplay and art style is fantastic. Definitely one of the best 2D fighting games I've played.

This game gives me the opportunity to do both. You spend time setting up your fleet and then you 'run the simulation' and watch to see how well you did. While the simulation runs i like to see how each weapon is performing, and how the new power armor is doing vs the heavy armor, or whatever I tweaked last time. If you love the details this game is for you, but it is easy to pick up and play by 1st timers, although ppl often get bored waiting for the battels to end.",
          "Rocket League is the long-awaited follow-up to SARPBC for the Playstation 3. While I did not own a copy of the original, I can safely say that Psyonix has done a fantastic job recreating and marketing the game to a new audience of young, competitive gamers. When I'm asked about the difference between Rocket League and any other game, the main difference I always fall back on (besides 'Car soccer, duh') is the controls. When you play League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, World of Literally ANY other A player feels removed from the gameplay by the controls. Hotkeys and shortcuts make you feel like you're telling your computer what to do. But in Rocket League, the controls ARE the car. The incredibly fluid physics and brilliantly intuitive controls make this game feel the best out of any I've ever played. No game from any other genre has had me so addicted to just MESSING AROUND. I just go in Free Play sometimes and play around with this tiny little rocket-powered physics sandbox I have before me, and marvel at how, just by fooling around with backwards aerials, I'm getting vastly better at the game. After 100 hours, the controls will start to feel supremely natural to you, and you won't be able to get away from how much you WANT. TO. PLAY. THIS. GAME. Oh and the game's kind of fun, too."

          "Rocket League is the long-awaited follow-up to SARPBC for the Playstation 3. While I did not own a copy of the original, I can safely say that Psyonix has done a fantastic job recreating and marketing the game to a new audience of young, competitive gamers. When I'm asked about the difference between Rocket League and any other game, the main difference I always fall back on (besides 'Car soccer, duh') is the controls. When you play League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, World of Literally ANY other A player feels removed from the gameplay by the controls. Hotkeys and shortcuts make you feel like you're telling your computer what to do. But in Rocket League, the controls ARE the car. The incredibly fluid physics and brilliantly intuitive controls make this game feel the best out of any I've ever played. No game from any other genre has had me so addicted to just MESSING AROUND. I just go in Free Play sometimes and play around with this tiny little rocket-powered physics sandbox I have before me, and marvel at how, just by fooling around with backwards aerials, I'm getting vastly better at the game. After 100 hours, the controls will start to feel supremely natural to you, and you won't be able to get away from how much you WANT. TO. PLAY. THIS. GAME. Oh and the game's kind of fun, too."

          "I totaly dig this game. I like to stare at things and think about them, I enjoy looking at small details and figuring out what they meen in the bigger picture. This game gives me the opportunity to do both. You spend time setting up your fleet and then you 'run the simulation' and watch to see how well you did. While the simulation runs i like to see how each weapon is performing, and how the new power armor is doing vs the heavy armor, or whatever I tweaked last time. If you love the details this game is for you, but it is easy to pick up and play by 1st timers, although ppl often get bored waiting for the battels to end."

Finished it in that time and that included taking the dogs out for walks, making and eating dinner and such. I found it quite easy, but enjoyed my time with it. The developer seems to be promising some more stuff with the software, and I think it's great that they are working on a composition tool. The interface would be a great relaxing way to throw together some music. Would also love to see some longer compositions for the game portion. At the price point (I picked up on sale for about a dollar) I'd say it's certainly worth the cash. Enjoyable but simple (again, simple coming from a musical background. If you're tone deaf, it might be a bit more of a challenge).",

          "Warning! This review contains lots of comparison between Civilization: Beyond Earth and Civilization 5! TL;DR Pros: 1. Changes from linear tech-tree to 'tech web', allowing higher degree of freedom 2. Customizations of units 3. Better spy system 4. Orbital units provide more options for economy / military 5. THERE IS NO GANDHI! Cons: 1. Lack of personalities for faction leaders 2. Removal of background when talking to leaders 3. No cultural music related to the faction 4. No scenarios to play with, only normal game can be setup 5. Bad minimap design 6. Doesn't feel like developing a civilization over the course of time 7. Different terrains looks same to me. Recommendations: 1. Not worth the USD, wait for sales until it is priced about $30 2. Consider Civ5: Complete Edition if the background setting isn't a factor to you Main Thoughts: As a player that owns all the expansions + DLCs of Civ5 and has more than 200 hours of gameplay, I must say that Civilization: Beyond Earth is a step back from Civ5. First, stations (city-states in Civ:BE) are simply just trading stations. You simply establish a trade route with the station to gain its advantage. They aren't considered as a small faction and doesn't have any armies. You no longer need to deal with them to earn a diplomatic advantage over other factions. Second, almost all of the victory conditions except domination are about advancing in the tech-web and earning affinities to unlock the victory structures. They are actually the same thing albeit their names. In Civ5 however, different victories requires different strategies and aspects of gameplay to achieve. Take cultural victory and diplomatic victory as an example, you dig up different artifacts or create arts / writings / songs to earn tourism points for the cultural victory. You also need to consider rushing certain wonders / buildings to get the theming bonus. But for the diplomatic victory, you will have to do many quests for the citiy-states to earn their trust and bring them under control, or simply trade with other civilizations to make them vote for you. All of these are gone in Civ:BE. Third, different terrains in the Civ:BE look almost the same to me. It is probably related to the colour tone of the game that makes the contrast between different terrains type not so obvious. Or simply that I don't enough game time to spot the difference between them. I should also point out the bad design of the minimap. There are only 4 types of things on you minimap: Land (owned / not own), Unexplored region, Sea and Resources. To study the terrain better, you must pan you camera to that area. There are actually a lot of impassable terrains that are not marked on the minimap. Other than that, dealing with AI factions hasn't improved at all. They share the same dialogue and chat options as in Civ5. Even worse, the background when you are talking to the faction leader is removed. The only thing you got is the leader standing and talking to you, with the map you last viewed as the background. No, you don't have Ceasar sitting in the throne room anymore, nor will you have Washington talking to you in his office. Interactions with AI factions aren't dynamic already, removal of backgrounds just make it even worse. Speaking of that, although you can tell the origin of the factions in Civ:BE, you somehow don't think they are related except the name. It is probably about the futuristic settings and lack of cultural BGM. There are a few improvements that worth mentioning. The spy system has revamped that allows you to perform different actions in other cities. You can steal energy (gold), science point or cause havoc with a giant worm. With different level of affinities, you can customize your units through choices of traits. This is what makes you army 'unique' to others as the basic units are always the same. You can also launch orbital units to assist you through different buffs. For example, a solar collector can provide +1 energy for the grids it covers, while others can improve combat strength. One cannot simply ignore the usefulness of these orbital units. To sum up, I only recommend Civilization: Beyond Earth to players who prefer Sci-fi 4X games. It doesn't worth the $50 USD, probably just $30, so just wait for a sale. If the theme setting is not a factor of consideration, go and pickup Civilization 5: Complete Edition instead. The game system of Civ 5 may not be the best as compared to older Civ series, but it is more versatile, enjoyable and replayable than Civilization: Beyond Earth.",

You also need to consider rushing certain wonders / buildings to get the theming bonus. But for the diplomatic victory, you will have to do many quests for the citiy-states to earn their trust and bring them under control, or simply trade with other civilizations to make them vote for you. All of these are gone in Civ:BE. Third, different terrains in the Civ:BE look almost the same to me. It is probably related to the colour tone of the game that makes the contrast between different terrains type not so obvious. Or simply that I don't enough game time to spot the difference between them. I should also point out the bad design of the minimap. There are only 4 types of things on you minimap: Land (owned / not own), Unexplored region, Sea and Resources. To study the terrain better, you must pan you camera to that area. There are actually a lot of impassable terrains that are not marked on the minimap. Other than that, dealing with AI factions hasn't improved at all. They share the same dialogue and chat options as in Civ5. Even worse, the background when you are talking to the faction leader is removed. The only thing you got is the leader standing and talking to you, with the map you last viewed as the background. No, you don't have Ceasar sitting in the throne room anymore, nor will you have Washington talking to you in his office. Interactions with AI factions aren't dynamic already, removal of backgrounds just make it even worse. Speaking of that, although you can tell the origin of the factions in Civ:BE, you somehow don't think they are related except the name. It is probably about the futuristic settings and lack of cultural BGM. There are a few improvements that worth mentioning. The spy system has revamped that allows you to perform different actions in other cities. You can steal energy (gold), science point or cause havoc with a giant worm. With different level of affinities, you can customize your units through choices of traits. This is what makes you army 'unique' to others as the basic units are always the same. You can also launch orbital units to assist you through different buffs. For example, a solar collector can provide +1 energy for the grids it covers, while others can improve combat strength. One cannot simply ignore the usefulness of these orbital units. To sum up, I only recommend Civilization: Beyond Earth to players who prefer Sci-fi 4X games. It doesn't worth the $50 USD, probably just $30, so just wait for a sale. If the theme setting is not a factor of consideration, go and pickup Civilization 5: Complete Edition instead. The game system of Civ 5 may not be the best as compared to older Civ series, but it is more versatile, enjoyable and replayable than Civilization: Beyond Earth."

          "TL;DR : If it comes free with your Vive, or if you have access to it via family sharing, or can get it for 7 - 10 bucks, go for it. Otherwise, skip it. The Gallery: Call of the Starseed isn't really a bad 'experience', but it's very short and somewhat rudimentary. The main problem is that, just as things are starting to ramp up, the experience is over. The first setting of the game, the beach, has more mini-distractions than the rest of the game put together, which is almost a beeline if you don't count a small maze as a distraction. The default method of movement is holding down the left track pad and aiming with your vision. Do yourself a favor and switch this to where your pointing with your hand. It's less of a pain in the neck, more accurate, and faster overall. Like many Vive games, Starseed uses a teleportation mechanic, which is fine, but they have an extra 'orientation' feature which never really felt intuitive to anyone I showed it to. The 'grab' of the hands is somewhat cumbersome and you'll pick up things you don't mean to if they are near something else, including picking the section of gameplay you want to start from the title menu/desk thing. It seems like it needs to be tightend up a bit. There aren't many characters in the game, but neither are animated in a compelling way. What's most compelling is the scale in VR- the characters are a little flat in facial expressions to be honest. One character talks almost nonstop and, for some reason, doesn't have any sort of animation for speaking. It kind of kicks immersion in the teeth. Otherwise, I like the locals, and the fidelity of the locations is very nice. The sounds aren't bad, but not really a whole lot going on. The puzzles are sort of short and simple, nothing that will keep an intelligent person with some coordination busy for too long. This game's price recently dropped down to but honestly this game could be completed in one sitting at a friend's house. I'm interested in upcoming episodes, but they'd need either a lot more content, a lot more 'gameplay', or a reduced pricepoint, as for this isn't cutting it for me. I could see tops, but it's just so short and simple, and the only replay value is completing achievements (most of which are very easy and are done on the first level). While I would say it's a very worth Vive experience to showcase what it can do, from a buyer's standpoint: consider something with more depth or more replayability unless this game is discounted.",

          "Bloody, Violent, Hard, Intresting, Weird, Fun, Awesome soundtrack. These are just a few words to describe this awesome Game. I actually got it and found about it through PayDay 2 with it's HotLine Miami DLC which adds guns, melee weapons, masks, and a mission from this game. But After I played the Heist on there I wanted to go try it out. At a price of only it was a good price. And well worth it if you ask me. So I would rate a high because some times you get agitated for dying so much and fast and for the fact I can not figure out how to pick up the puzzle peices I only have one piece of it and can't find more. But Also after I beat this one I am looking very forward to the second HotLine coming out soon.",

          "Warning! This review contains lots of comparison between Civilization: Beyond Earth and Civilization 5! TL;DR Pros: 1. Changes from linear tech-tree to 'tech web', allowing higher degree of freedom 2. Customizations of units 3. Better spy system 4. Orbital units provide more options for economy / military 5. THERE IS NO GANDHI! Cons: 1. Lack of personalities for faction leaders 2. Removal of background when talking to leaders 3. No cultural music related to the faction 4. No scenarios to play with, only normal game can be setup 5. Bad minimap design 6. Doesn't feel like developing a civilization over the course of time 7. Different terrains looks same to me. Recommendations: 1. Not worth the USD, wait for sales until it is priced about $30 2. Consider Civ5: Complete Edition if the background setting isn't a factor to you Main Thoughts: As a player that owns all the expansions + DLCs of Civ5 and has more than 200 hours of gameplay, I must say that Civilization: Beyond Earth is a step back from Civ5. First, stations (city-states in Civ:BE) are simply just trading stations. You simply establish a trade route with the station to gain its advantage. They aren't considered as a small faction and doesn't have any armies. You no longer need to deal with them to earn a diplomatic advantage over other factions. Second, almost all of the victory conditions except domination are about advancing in the tech-web and earning affinities to unlock the victory structures. They are actually the same thing albeit their names. In Civ5 however, different victories requires different strategies and aspects of gameplay to achieve. Take cultural victory and diplomatic victory as an example, you dig up different artifacts or create arts / writings / songs to earn tourism points for the cultural victory. You also need to consider rushing certain wonders / buildings to get the theming bonus. But for the diplomatic victory, you will have to do many quests for the citiy-states to earn their trust and bring them under control, or simply trade with other civilizations to make them vote for you. All of these are gone in Civ:BE. Third, different terrains in the Civ:BE look almost the same to me. It is probably related to the colour tone of the game that makes the contrast between different terrains type not so obvious. Or simply that I don't enough game time to spot the difference between them. I should also point out the bad design of the minimap. There are only 4 types of things on you minimap: Land (owned / not own), Unexplored region, Sea and Resources. To study the terrain better, you must pan you camera to that area. There are actually a lot of impassable terrains that are not marked on the minimap. Other than that, dealing with AI factions hasn't improved at all. They share the same dialogue and chat options as in Civ5. Even worse, the background when you are talking to the faction leader is removed. The only thing you got is the leader standing and talking to you, with the map you last viewed as the background. No, you don't have Ceasar sitting in the throne room anymore, nor will you have Washington talking to you in his office. Interactions with AI factions aren't dynamic already, removal of backgrounds just make it even worse. Speaking of that, although you can tell the origin of the factions in Civ:BE, you somehow don't think they are related except the name. It is probably about the futuristic settings and lack of cultural BGM. There are a few improvements that worth mentioning. The spy system has revamped that allows you to perform different actions in other cities. You can steal energy (gold), science point or cause havoc with a giant worm. With different level of affinities, you can customize your units through choices of traits. This is what makes you army 'unique' to others as the basic units are always the same. You can also launch orbital units to assist you through different buffs. For example, a solar collector can provide +1 energy for the grids it covers, while others can improve combat strength. One cannot simply ignore the usefulness of these orbital units. To sum up, I only recommend Civilization: Beyond Earth to players who prefer Sci-fi 4X games. It doesn't worth the $50 USD, probably just $30, so just wait for a sale. If the theme setting is not a factor of consideration, go and pickup Civilization 5: Complete Edition instead. The game system of Civ 5 may not be the best as compared to older Civ series, but it is more versatile, enjoyable and replayable than Civilization: Beyond Earth.",

I was expecting to have to wait one to four months for episode two, but I got to play it on Halloween. If you feel like you've made a wrong decision after completing an episode, you can do what I did, start a second save file and make different decisions. All in all, I'd give the game an The reason I've given the game an is because it does feel like they just threw characters at you every 5 minutes. But it does have some of the required characters to make a good adventure, the hero no one would expect, the jerk who constantly harasses you and sabitoge what you're doing, the friends that help you along the way, the cool girl, the guy you'd think to be just another jerk but is really a nice guy, the heroes from a long time ago, and the guy that was one of those heroes but then did something no one knows about and then does some crap that almost kills everyone.

Instead, you just end up picking a party of characters, optimize their performance with player personalities, buy add-ons for your gameroom that give character bonuses such as a better table or door, and meander through a roleplaying world which has little plot in itself nevermind the lack of out-of-character plot among the players. There isn't THAT much grinding if you do all the quests and use your items and gameroom bonuses appropriately to multiply the amount of experience and gold you get from battles, but you still have to complete slayer quests which are like how in MMOs you have to kill so many monsters for a reward. The battle system is rather repetitive too. Basically, you just get a taunting tank, heal it, and disable opponents while bombarding them with a magic dps and melee dps. This goes on over and over with no change in tactics. I say this despite how you can 'choose the difficulty' by picking how many monsters you want to fight. It's either you pick too little monsters to bother, pick just enough to repeat over and over, or pick too many to handle. On the plus side, you can grab revive items in the shop in case your party dies out rather than paying the revive cost if you pick too many to handle, but it still doesn't make up for the repetition. This is compounded by the ridiculous investment needed to level up the blacksmith by buying 'grindstones'. Each one costs 25 coins, yet the optimal levels of upgrading require around 100 grindstones. Basically, that means you have to earn 6-7k coins, and when you're earning around 50-100 coins per fight until about 75% of the way through the game where you start earning 250-300 coins per fight, that means you're not going to experience using the blacksmith for a very long time. You also need to buy enough luck amulets and great molten rings to make the optimal level cost effective, and you have to buy gameroom items to accelerate your income, so that's another 2-3k. This ignores how you're spending coins on other things, so it really takes a long time just to unlock better equipment for your party. The campaign ultimately feels like a tutorial sampler of what the game has to offer. Had the game included a custom campaign editor, this would be awesome since players could make their own material and share it in the community. Heck, the campaign even feels like it'll unlock this towards the end in saying how the gameworld is much bigger than what you can see, but it never gets unlocked. Also, the new classes you unlock are mostly pointless. They're effective, but you have to level them up instead of being able to introduce them into the game right away, and that's a huge timesink. Even if you play 'New Game+' you still have to level them up. This really stinks since it'd be nice to immediately jump into using a barbarian, knight, shaman, bard, and necromancer instead of a warrior, cleric, druid, mage, and rogue. The game however just says, 'NO. YOU DO HARD WAY OR NOT AT ALL! GRRR!' On the other hand, if you start a plain old new game for the party, then you have to go through the hassle of upgrading the blacksmith all over again! Don't forget the great molten rings or luck amulets too! To be fair, you don't have to buy the income earning gameroom upgrades again, and you can technically grind out the income with your previous party in your other game since coins pool from all saved games, but still, you're talking about a good 8-9k in coins just to upgrade the blacksmith again. At that rate, you might as well just buy experience potions for 100 coins a pop to give everyone 6500 experience, plus you can buy the potion upgrades in the game room and use Ronaldo for the potion still, it's just more repetition. This is supposed to be a roleplaying game instead of a railroad shooter. If the devs just spend a little more time on writing a plot, this game could have been awesome, but they didn't, so it flopped.",

Free to play helps a lot for those strapped for cash but there are options to help developers work on the game by purchasing cosmetic upgrades and inventory/stash upgrades in game with steam cash. The only thing missing is Cain to id items, a Secret Cow Level and all of those rush groups you likely remember from D II. I usually play solo because I can't see a darn thing with 3 or more players spamming abilities and spells but younger players likely will not be bothered.",

          "Trove, it was fun for a few minutes until you relize that the entire games is a few diffrent dungeons in a few diffrent biomes wich you complete over and over again to get materials wich you craft into useless cosmetics. This game is extremely grindy. About 70% of the items you find in the game are not as good as the ones you currently have and are only used to get a miniscule amount of crafting materials and a 'style' wich lets you change the items you have equipt to look diffrent. The combat is less than amazing, inovative or fun. The combat seems to get verry repetitive using three abilities against the same enemies and the same dungeons over and over again to collect nearly useless loot wich you use to craft to make more items to help you collect more useless loot. I have many friends who play this game alot and theircounter argument is usually it has tons of content and you can build and fight enemies. There are a few things wrong with this statement, one all the content of the game is about 10 dungeons in 15 biomes themed differently and all the items in the game are similar or the same items with diffrent 'styles' wich you can collect, all of the games content is in cosmetics and grinding things to get more cosmetics. Well you might be thinking I like cosmetics whats wrong with lots of cosmetics? Well I like cosmetics too but all of the games content is cosmetics there is nothing else to do in the game after you have collected all of the cosmetics wich is almost imposible considering that the entire game consists of a randomly generated world with repetitive dungeons an unenjoyable combat system and tons of re skins. The second thing wrong with the counter argument is you can build and fight enemies, yes you can build in a 10x10 area with unlimited space up and down but there is nothing to put in your house once you finish and it is not permenent because you carry it around with you and drop it down on a cornerstone or building plot when you need to drop of loot or refil potions. Now, onto the comabt system, the combat system contains three abilities and manual aiming wich are all seem cool for the first few minutes but then it becomes repetitive and you do all this combat to level up your character wich is useless since all the levels do is put you in a higher level area wich is the same as the last but you get slightly diffrent loot and have tougher enemies. In conclusion this game is a voxel based mmo grind thats focused on cosmetics and not the important aspects of the game like world map or combat or building. This game is just a grind. Personaly I would recomend Hexxit rather than this, yes I would suggest a minecraft modpack over a stand alone game, my reasoning is Hexxit is verry similar to this game except you are not limited to a 10x10 area for your creativity, there are more dungeons and a larger loot varriety in a much more flexible game with the only downside being lack of dedicated servers. My final opinion I would not reccomend this game but you should try it before judging it considering that its free and you may like it but as it is I do not recomend it."

The free running is quite good and interacting with the enviroment makes things very exciting as you keep looking for the next place to run to even when fighting.

There are lots of items which you will find that you are not told what they might be used for but I am assuming that they either create something for end game or are a hidden achievement. One minor issue if you are using a mouse/keyboard over a controller is when picking locks you have to be very aware of what you are looking at as their is no feedback vibration. So if you are pickng a lock make sure it turns smoothly or else the pick will break."

Game is pretty good and the only big gripes I have thus far are performance issues (My first CPU core is running at 100 % but the other five are between 10-15 % of their use at max, so it isn't utilizing cores properly), and I seem to desync with my coop buddies after an hour or two, but this can be rectified by dropping out and rejoining, wihch takes about 15 - 20 seconds. Overall / 10 for me. Would be a 9 / 10 if the technical issues got fixed."

Its short, yes but the experience you are getting from it is pretty unique for an adventure game which uses virtual reality. And letting some friends play it makes it worth the money. Really worth checking out!",

Really Fun and hard game, doesn't really run well with mouse and keyboard from experience, I highly reccomend a Controller, Overall this game is Amaze-Balls."

A great change for the better that deserves special recognition is the fact that now once again the game is based on soul levels , not soul memory. So dying and losing a great amount of souls , while still means a setback , doesnt mean you should just delete your char and start over. OBS: If you intend to play this game , keep backups , there are tools that can automatically do this for you even. This is an important note.",
