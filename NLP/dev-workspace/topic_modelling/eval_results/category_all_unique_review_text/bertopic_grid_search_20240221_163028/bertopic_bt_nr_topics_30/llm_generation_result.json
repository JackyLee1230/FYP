      "call_2": "I recommend this game. Bethesda have designed and created a true masterpiece. The Elder Scrolls series is some really great lore, the feel it has is so immersive, more so to our own I feel, and I have to say, slightly more so than Tolkiens lore on middle earth. Skyrim's feel is no different to the other games in the franchise, altho I must admit I haven't had the pleasure of expieriencing any of them other than a small 1 hour, 1 death play of Morrowind, Skyrim, of course, in fact I believe to have over 2000 hours of gameplay in Skyrim, as I play on the Xbox 360 most of my time, and my fellow brethren allow me to indulge them in some lore and I'll do some roleplay with their character which we don't mind. Oblivion also, I've had many an adventure in the realm of oblivion and Cyrodill, I even have the game manual and every DLC, paid full price as on the XBOX. Probally countless more hours on that game, and I'm definitely familiar with lore in The Elder Scrolls, however, the freedom and power that come with playing and being immersed in an Elder Scrolls game is unlike any other, thanks to bethesda softworks and many other countless reasons :OO: the impact it has on the way at least I think, is significant, makes me want to roleplay,and I shall set out and weave my own fate, :') If you play skyrim, and your rig, whatever you play on. be it laptop, linux I think you can run it on? Mac, anything I guess, if its about the average, I say you definatley should get some mods running with skyrim, it only matters that you have the right and required system/rig, to run it on IF you want graphical mods, or highly increase data and such, otherwise, not so important. You would want to go to Nexus mods and community, on the web, and search on catorgorys for anything your interested in. Also before I tell you what I have, you will need to know how to install mods, if you don't already know, of course if you are unsure of anything you may not want to mess anything up or waste your time to try it, for a great guide on how to do almost everything with mods, search YouTube for Gopher, and watch his video on, well anything, hes a great guy and he explains all you need to know better than most people do that I've seen haha. Hope you get through that alright, and really, if your under 10 years old, which its sort of illegal or breaking some rules if you are, to play the game extra, you might find it hard to understand, skip things and not do what you need to correctly, causing things to get messy and possibly broken. Don't take shortcuts (follow the guidance/trail) you can ask me anything on the matter too I'd be a good start to ask on. It is a great life experience to explore and adventure Skyrim, turn HUD off at the start if I were you, to be more immersed, and if you will add mods, play through the beggining untill you are 'Unbound' and start to configure, and do not forget to save! Oh that's another thing, if you have more than 4 saves it usually causes loads of problems, like Crash To Desktop and corruption with data, that sort, so limit your saves wisely. Just to say, there is a mod made for Skyrim, for littrally 60% of what ever you think of, and if not, make it :), hardly limited, I don't know how to say to people that they should start playing If you, are hungry for adventure, seek the land of Skyrim!

      "call_2": "\nTopic Label: Dishonored 2",
      "call_3": "Okay, here is the rewritten review with the suggested changes:\n\n\"I liked Dishonored. That's about as far as I get in my opinion of it. I'm finding it hard to formulate a more complex opinion of it because the game itself is not very complex. There were some things I liked and some things I didn't, all evening out to a even experience. There was more good than bad, so this gets a positive review.\n\nThe game play sports some of the better designed stealth mechanics in the genre. Clearly defined visibility and reasonable movement speed, especially when crouched, provide a solid core for the game to build around. Your powers evolve the game into a rewarding experience: the ability to teleport allows for creative solutions to problems. The ability to see through walls is great for planning your next move and adapting your strategy to changes in the situation; even if it does diminish any sense of tension and takes away from art design by making you decide whether to leave it on all the time or not. Some powers are more valuable than others however, and are even redundant. The power to slow or stop time is nice for dismantling a complex situation all at once, while the ability to summon a swarm of rats to eat bodies and attack enemies is incredibly useful. I never bothered with the ability to possess animals or people as it was easier and more rewarding to dispatch them with the abilities I already had. The power to turn your victims to dust to prevent their bodies from being discovered is outclassed by the ability to summon a swarm of rats, which eat bodies and also attack enemies.\n\nThe setting is interesting and I enjoyed exploring its facets. Set in a steam punk allegory for London, a deadly disease (a black plague allusion) is killing huge swaths of the population. You play as Corvo, personal bodyguard to the queen of Not-England and father figure to her daughter, the princess, who's real father is never mentioned nor is the idea of her conception explored. Upon returning home to your surrogate family, the queen is murdered by assassins and the princess is kidnapped, leading me to assume Corvo was not the valedictorian of bodyguard school. Corvo is framed for the crime and sentenced to death, but not before being held captive by the villainously bald spymaster who has become Nazi dictator of Not-England because apparently he was next in line to rule. After making his daring escape from prison, Corvo is inducted into the secret resistance to overthrow bald Hitler comprising a bunch of high ranking dudes from the government who then proceed to have Corvo do literally almost everything while they sit at the bar of their secret base and drink.\n\nThe problem I had with the plot is that the characters are aggressively one-dimensional and might as well scrawl their secret plans on the wall with crayon. Everything they do is taken right out of a plot-by-numbers book and if you can't see the surprise twist coming then you must be blind AND deaf, because even if you can't see, every character might as well publicize their intentions with a megaphone. There are two endings to the game, one for players who took all the good options and one for players who took the bad, so we can add binary moral choice to the pile of anchors that weighs down the story.\n\nIn the end, I can recommend Dishonored for the stealth but not for the story. The good balanced out the bad in a way that makes this game a good purchase on sale.\"'''.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
      "call_4": "It seems like you have a mixed opinion of the game Dishonored 2. On one hand, you praise the gameplay mechanics and stealth aspects of the game, finding them to be well-designed and enjoyable. However, you also express disappointment with the story and characters, feeling that they are not as developed or engaging as in the first game. Additionally, you mention that the game's length can make up for some of its shortcomings, but only if purchased on sale. Overall, it seems like Dishonored 2 is a game with both strengths and weaknesses, and your opinion of it will depend on your personal preferences and what you are looking for in a gaming experience."

          "This game is literally a stand alone version of Faultline Games' mod to Natural Selection 2. If you like Natural Selection 2 and enjoy playing it then you will enjoy this game. If you have not played Natural Selection 2 then do not buy this game until the developers add a demo of some sort. This is a multiplayer game akin to Team Fortress or tribes, there is no single player content aside from playing against extremely rudimentary bots. This game is built on the premise of being a competitive asymmetrical pvp game that is fought between two factions: Marines and aliens called the Khara. Marines are similar to playing an older FPS with contemporary mechanics. The Khara are similar to playing a handful of different games. There is a player leveling system based on experience points gained in game. There is a character progression system in play sessions that levels up the player character to unlock things in the game. On the Marine side this in-session leveling system is used to unlock guns and exosuits. On the Khara side this system is used to unlock abilities and new classes. A general description of the game paints it as intruiging, which is true: the concept is interesting. The execution is where most of the game's shortcoming come from. There isn't enough to differentiate this game from Natural Selection 2, but instead it feels like the in-session progression system is a half-baked mechanic. This game's success is dependent on it being different enough from Natural Selection 2 to draw players away from it, and yet it is not. It is so similar to Natural Selection 2's mod called Combat that many players who like the series are staying there or boycotting this game. On average there are 30 players playing this game, and those are mostly the holdouts who want the game to succeed. On Octorber 30th the game had a large spike in players going up to 116, then increasing to 128 players by Nov 1st. However, these numbers droped to 56 by Nov 4th, and have more or less been on a slow and steady decline. It appears that new players join the game and then quit shortly after. This should tell you the kind of game you are getting here. If new players are joining and then quitting within a week then there are massive problems with the game itself. This game's biggest problem is that it does nothing to retain new players. The players who are already playing and have hundreds of hours in the game and love it will continue playing\u2014they are the holdouts\u2014but new players will play for a week or so and then quit to play something more accessable. New players are pitted against experienced players and there are no mechanics to help new players win. There are no first optimal strategies that have low skill and reward ceilings such as CoD's noob-tube, Street Fighter's thousand hand slap, or Unreal Tournament 99's rocket launcher. New players are thrown into a meat grinder, and they quickly decide they do not want to play this game. People who are enjoying it will tell them that it takes 50 - 200 hours to properly enjoy the game, but the problem is that there is nothing to ease new players into enjoying the game. No lower skill strategies that evolve into higher skill strategies whereby noobs become pros. The other primary problem with this game is the community. The developers will ban people from the forums for 'trolling' and then cite their rules instead of actually trying to find out what is wrong and why the player feels negatively about the game. The community itself can be extremely toxic, and that just leads into negativity going all around. If you live in the you can more or less try this game without risk since you can return it after playing it if you do not enjoy it. If you live outside the where that law does not apply then buy at your own risk. If you speak negatively about this game the developers will, instead of working towards making their product better, pursue you onto whatever social media they can find that you use and harass you there. True professionals, though it is good for a laugh from time to time. This will tell you how many people are playing the game before you buy it. I regret this purchase. A great many other people also regret buying this. Many of the posititve reviews are either from developers or people who absolutely loved the mod before it became a standalone. The negative reviews come from people who are not pros at Natural Selection 2.",
          "I got this as part of the Daedalic Armageddon bundle, and played it after playing the Deponia trilogy (which I loved) - and it does not disappoint. It's a sweet little game, with a compelling story and likeable characters. Like the other Daedalic games that I've played so far, it took me about 10 hours to complete, which is quite a nice length for a game of this type. It's unique selling point, and one of the reasons that I enjoyed playing it so much, is that you have magic powers. The main character only has one power - to break things, such as glass. Later, you are also able to fix things. It is this constant mechanic that makes this game so interesting. It makes you think around a problem very differently - for example, you may need to break something in your inventory, then use it, and then fix it again to solve a puzzle. This, and other constant useful items such as the knife and the flint and steel, makes this game more of a proper adventure. I, with my trusty knife and my magical skills, can do anything. Well, almost anything. Some things. The game does, however, have it's flaws. Some of the puzzles are, in my opinion, a little bit too obscure for their own good. This is mostly down to this game's tendency to give you too many items at once (that, and an inventory system which is quite difficult to navigate, rather than in Deponia, where it is possible to see all of your items at once). Too many things at once does make it a bit difficult to work out what you're supposed to use, and even if it doesn't, the solutions are not always the easiest to work out. I made it through most of the game without help, most of the puzzles were challenging, not impossible, but sometimes you just don't know what they're getting at, and still don't understand it after you've googled the solution. I don't know, I may just suck at point and click games. This is by no means a reason not to play it. The achievement system is weird. You make certain choices throughout the game, which don't affect the story much but do get you certain achievements (if you're bothered about that). The problem is, it's not just that you MISS achievements (there're some which it might not occur to you to try to get), you CAN'T get all of them in one playthrough. The achievement system contains alternative achievements, for each and every way of doing something. This is a little odd, but it isn't really important. The main disappointment for me was the ending. There was nothing wrong with it, in itself - but it was abrupt. I had the same problem with Deponia (although the ending there was slightly less fulfilling). You complete the game, and it's just over. A little bit of a trailoff, but it doesn't hang around to say goodbye. There IS a second game to play - but, unlike Deponia, it isn't just a continuation of the same story. This story ended, and I felt a little cheated of closure at the end. Not much - and maybe it's because I was just sad to finish playing it - but there were a couple of loose ends, to say the least. No matter, I'm greatly looking forward to the next game. Hopefully it will fill in some of the gaps. The Daedalic bundle is a great buy on sale (mostly just for Deponia and this, and maybe another game or two), I'm very quickly becoming a big fan of this company."

          "This game is a game that starts so well and I want to like it so badly but i just cannot. The graphics are really great they add so much to the game. The story starts really interestingly for first 30 minutes but it soon becomes really bad same with the characters at first you feel like this might be a platformer that has characters and story like monkey island but they soon lose their charm. I am on the last level of the game currently and I just want it to end and i have felt this way for most of my time in the game There are occasionally really great moment but they become more few and far between the more you play. Most of the game is ridiculously easy but there are some certain difficulty spikes at times that feel like they are there just to prolong the game. Some of the bosses get really annoying and certain platforming and puzzle sequences get frustrating. I dont play a lot of platform games so this might vary from person to person. I find the controls work well sometimes but when they dont work they really make you mad. They are quite clunky but there are parts where you need to jump, or do a prolonged jump or to jump and fly which all use the same button and it just doesnt work well often its hard to beat a platform difficulty spike area just because the controls are working against you. I think people review this game on how good it could have been rather than how good it actually is. Also in certain sections, usually around the difficulty spikes it makes you have to go through a cut scene type thing every time before u do the awkward bit. Yes you can mostly skip the cut scene but it takes time and it just prolongs the time it takes to get you back trying that part again. As well as that the cut scenes and dialoges often totally break the flow of the game. Overall I somewhat enjoyed some parts of the game but most of my play time I found either bored or frustrated. For me the price of this game is nonsensical. Steam price is as of writhing this but it is in no way worth more than I have played around 12 hours of this and probably enjoyed one or two of them. I do regret buying the game and i even more regret the time i put into it. Yes it could be great and yes at times it is great but for the most part in my opinion and experience it is not very good and way way way over priced. Dont believe the hype.",
          "I got this as part of the Daedalic Armageddon bundle, and played it after playing the Deponia trilogy (which I loved) - and it does not disappoint. It's a sweet little game, with a compelling story and likeable characters. Like the other Daedalic games that I've played so far, it took me about 10 hours to complete, which is quite a nice length for a game of this type. It's unique selling point, and one of the reasons that I enjoyed playing it so much, is that you have magic powers. The main character only has one power - to break things, such as glass. Later, you are also able to fix things. It is this constant mechanic that makes this game so interesting. It makes you think around a problem very differently - for example, you may need to break something in your inventory, then use it, and then fix it again to solve a puzzle. This, and other constant useful items such as the knife and the flint and steel, makes this game more of a proper adventure. I, with my trusty knife and my magical skills, can do anything. Well, almost anything. Some things. The game does, however, have it's flaws. Some of the puzzles are, in my opinion, a little bit too obscure for their own good. This is mostly down to this game's tendency to give you too many items at once (that, and an inventory system which is quite difficult to navigate, rather than in Deponia, where it is possible to see all of your items at once). Too many things at once does make it a bit difficult to work out what you're supposed to use, and even if it doesn't, the solutions are not always the easiest to work out. I made it through most of the game without help, most of the puzzles were challenging, not impossible, but sometimes you just don't know what they're getting at, and still don't understand it after you've googled the solution. I don't know, I may just suck at point and click games. This is by no means a reason not to play it. The achievement system is weird. You make certain choices throughout the game, which don't affect the story much but do get you certain achievements (if you're bothered about that). The problem is, it's not just that you MISS achievements (there're some which it might not occur to you to try to get), you CAN'T get all of them in one playthrough. The achievement system contains alternative achievements, for each and every way of doing something. This is a little odd, but it isn't really important. The main disappointment for me was the ending. There was nothing wrong with it, in itself - but it was abrupt. I had the same problem with Deponia (although the ending there was slightly less fulfilling). You complete the game, and it's just over. A little bit of a trailoff, but it doesn't hang around to say goodbye. There IS a second game to play - but, unlike Deponia, it isn't just a continuation of the same story. This story ended, and I felt a little cheated of closure at the end. Not much - and maybe it's because I was just sad to finish playing it - but there were a couple of loose ends, to say the least. No matter, I'm greatly looking forward to the next game. Hopefully it will fill in some of the gaps. The Daedalic bundle is a great buy on sale (mostly just for Deponia and this, and maybe another game or two), I'm very quickly becoming a big fan of this company."

          "Hi, I have played the main campaign on normal so far, alone though, because my friends dont bought the game (yet). I really like the story line and I have to say I like the game in general too. People may hate on it because 'it's not as good as Magicka 1', but this is another game, it isn't supposed to be all the same. I have played Magicka 1 and I loved that game too. Personally I think Paradox did a good job on trying to improve the game, while keeping the same(ish) ambiance as in Magicka 1 (all the references and the silly humor :3 ). Some things I didn't like: It seemed like my wizard was outside of my screen sometimes, like the gamescreen was actually larger than my laptop window, which was a little annoying. Futhermore, I couldn't walk back in some areas, while there was no loading screen. This really bothered me, because I was like, well, I check out this area first and then go overthere, and then enemies appeared and after slaying them I could not return to the other part T_T. I Also heard people complaining about the controls, but I haven't played Magicka 1 in a while so this was no issue for me. Beside these things, I'd recommend this game to anyone that liked Magicka 1, but don't go in thinking this is Magicka 1 with just some upgraded graphics, because you'll probably be disappointed. For alttabbers: alt tab is working fine, no crashes :) NOTE: I haven't played online yet so I don't know how laggy it will be, but they probably fixed that too. (Magicka 1 was kind of laggy for me sometimes).",

          "Dragons Dogma meh. And while its meh, it is a third person action rpg. It has its moments where it is enjoyable but loses momentum. Story wise this game is pretty lacking, no real attachments to any characters are made. Voice acting is there but it is nothing special. A vacant world with mediocre-quite good combat. Dragons Dogma is about a dude/dudet who gets selected to try and fight off a dragon. You have some little twist and turns but there is nothing jaw dropping. Its main pull is to be its combat system and gameplay. Gameplay is almost great but lacking some basic functions that hinder the style of combat it is going for. There is too much stagger for your characters and not enough for the enemy. The tactics invovled in taking down different monsters is very interesting but you cannot properly command your team which means that you cant employ tactics with the precision that you would like. The big flaws in within the combat system are: THERE IS NO REAL LOCK-ON SYSTEMS TO BE USED THERE IS NO DODGING TO BE HAD OTHER THAN AN UPGRADABLE FORWARD ROLL FOR ONE CHARACTER. I cannot state how much this damages the game in its immersion having to run S lines to avoid attacks feels dated and old and pulls you away from what would be a great combat system. The combat when engaging large enemies is enjoyable the fact that you can grab onto the monsters and climb around to different parts of the monster and damage individual limbs is great. A lock-on system here would again add a level of excitement as you would be able to see the monster in its entirety, but alas that is missing thus damaging the combat system in play. Overall 5/10 its an alright game if you can get it cheap you may aswell. Combat although a little cumbersome is still quite good and the story although bland is there, the world although vacant of npcs has a fair amount of enemies that are quite fun to learn and kill. The side quests and functions are there and they are alright, nothing out of the ordinary.",
          "Payday 2 is way much better than the first one! If you never played Payday before, get Payday 2 instead of the first one. Leveling up on the first one was a bit confusing to me, but the heists were still fun to play through and to get a feel for the game. I love playing this game, that is if you don't mind killing cops and security guards to get rich. Rob banks, cook Meth, destroy Malls, run errands for the mob, etc. and listen to Bain. He will keep ya out of trouble. God forbid don't kill any innocents! There are tons of weapons that can be modded out and lots of customization for the character that you choose to play. You can get lots of different masks to wear, and can re-craft them how you want if you got the right materials. Playing offline is ok, but the of your teammates suck. If you play online it is better and you will get rich fast if you play with people that know what they are doing. I have so many hours into this game than what it says because I played offline a lot. If you play on a harder level, prepare for a good challenge. Having a good team with different skillsets help. There is downloadable content that you can get for this game like extra weapons and extra heists. Did I mention this is a first-person shooter? If you are used to playing Counter-Strike with keyboard and mouse setup, you will be at home with the controls. There has been a lot of dlc content for this game that has come out. You don't have to have the dlc to a heist to play with a person that is hosting that heist on multiplayer. You don't really need all the dlc content to have fun. But I do suggest getting some of the starter Gage mod packs, and mod courier pack if anything. After a while, the dlc content just adds extra fun heists to do, more guns and weapons that really don't give you an advantage most of the time, and different masks and patterns to collect. There are a few character packs to add flavor and many many achievements to do ( i love these). Right now it's neverending with more dlc to come! This is a very popular game, if you played it, you would see why. Now go out and make some cash and get rich beyond your wildest dreams!"

          "The closest thing to a true star trek game, great indie rogue-like strategy game. I just wanted to update this review and say that i found mods for this game. Didn't even know they had them. Mainly because i beat the game and wanted to play more and the mods for this make it 10 times better because you can play it even more and have new ships, weapons enemies and abilities. This game is worth it no matter if it's on sale or not. What I liked: A good space combat game Tons of weapons, upgrades and variety of ships to use and kill MODS!!! What You Need to Know: Seriously the mods make this game a must own. ( tons more ships, weapons, parts, crew and even a new mechanics) Just find Captains Edition for FTL after you beat the great game at least once. My Score:",
          "Insurgency is practically one of the worst 'realistic' shooters I have ever played so far in my career of writing reviews and stuff. Where do I even begin here. Oh yeah, let's start with what it's about. This is a shooter game like Call of Duty, but I think it's aim was supposed to be was to be as realistic (and as unfair) as possible. It's a cool game. I'd go as to far as saying that I actually like and I'm sort of addicted to this game. Of course, having minimal hours on it, I have to discuss both the pros and cons about this game and evaluate them together to make a review. Of course, you already saw that I picked 'No' as recommending this game. I'll get to that in just a moment. The good parts about this game is that it takes the realism to a good level. Snipers, sub-machine guns, you can put anything you want onto your gun. A silencer, a sight, tracer ammo. You name it, and it's there. Maybe not everything, but it's to a customizable degree and that's one thing I like about this game. Another thing I like about this game is the way they claim stealth. In stealth games like PAYDAY 2, stealth is my kind of thing that I'd always like to do. Screw a silencer onto your gun, and you'll be practically untracable. Or so you think. I'll get to why you THINK it's stealth. Oh, and my final way that I think that this game is great is It's kind of hard to explain. I like the aiming down and firing mechanics of the weapons. They're so fluent. That's all I can really think of right now for how good the game is. Let's move on to the terrible things about this game that ruins it. The AI. That's all I have to say and it makes this game terrible. I don't know about you, but I don't really like playing multiplayer games like CS:GO online competitively all the time. Although I do like CS:GO Competitive, I never played Insurgency's competitive, but it's probably just as toxic as CS:GO's community by far. Anyway, the AI is just terrible. I actually played a game recently, and 5 terrorists or Insurgents or whatever they call them walked infront of my AI character(s) and none of them noticed. All the security forces were mowed down, and since all of them came in force and pushed us back, I died as well. Game over. Instead of making new impossible modes that combine 25 vs 4, fix your AI first and maybe I'd actually come back and make a new review. Another way that the game pretty much ruins it is the weight. Your suppressor takes pounds? It doesn't specify. It takes 3. If you want silencers on both your guns, you'll need to strip down to bare bones to actually 'stealth' and be a recon. The final thing that ruins this game and makes it unplayable is the stealth. Stealth doesn't work. I put silencers on my guns and I fought them behind their back. They turned instantly around for no reason and killed me. Every. Time. I. TRIED. The stealth just doesn't work because they coded their AI in such a twisted way that they're robots that are designed to kill instead of actual terrorists, but I'm getting off-topic. Time for the evaluation. Combined with the crappy AI, crappy stealth, weight system, and all the good things such as customizable weaponry, fluent controls/aiming down Don't buy this game. That's my evaluation. Just don't buy it. If it's on sale and if you want to try it, give it a try and maybe you'll like it more than I do, but that's all I really have to say. TL;DR: A shooter that tries to be as realistic as possible, but fails with bugged AI, and terrible stealth mechanics."

          "Free to play, in the right dirrection. So many games that are free to play are like swimming with a lead life vest. To get it off, you have to pay for the key to properly stay afloat. WarFrame has nothing like that, they just put the islands far away as hell and you can choose at what pace you get to them. With alot of F2P games, 90% of the content is locked behind a wall of money, but here it's the opposite. A vast majority of what you see is free. Frames (Characters) are all attainable by grinding the pieces and resources needed to build them as goes with the weapons too. By default you get one of the base Frames and base weapons of your choice, with the availability to get 1 aditional frame and eight weapons without paying a single dime. With the starting free money they give you, it's possible to unlock additional frames and weapons spots to have more off the bat. The only thing you cannot get free are color chemes, some animations and so on, but those are all asthetics. It's possible to play the game end to end without spending any money. Story is a general MMO stereotype, you have control of a powerful character, grindy missions, save the universe ect. Not much more to it than that. There are very few games I get headlong into the Lore of and this is not one of them. There may be more than what I said, but I don't feel compelled to learn the in and out of every faction. There are several starting story missions to get you the required gear to play any game type and an NPC companion for free. The combat is great, controls are tight and responsive. Popping a headshot is easy the run/slide and hump feels natural after a few minutes of gameplay. The parkour/wall running is a bit buggy, but there is no penalty for falling out of bounds as it just pops you back into the level. Combat difficulty is a bit high later on into the games, making it necessary to team up with others to help ease the load, but you can jump into a game and play with random players if there are any for the selected mission. Weapon selection is a bit low, as I love having hundreds of guns to play with, but they have a decent selection of pistols, rifles, bows and ultimate (Prime) weapons and power cards to make them all better as you level them up. Standard affair for weapons: Rifles, snipers, bows, shotguns, SMG's and pistols Graphics are great, I'm running an Nvidia 750. It runs on high settings, but not ultra, even so it's a gorgeous game that looks beautiful through each planet/level. The levels are based off of tile sets and wind up being different missions constructed with the same pieces but a different lay out on each planet/ship you go through. While level designs are endless, you start to see alot of similarities over time even with the different variations of each. Right off the bat, this isn't a game I play alot and usually with friends only. I am hesitant about spending any money on it as this is more of a social game for me, play with friends and have fun. If this is your scene and you love the game to death, there's nothing wrong with dropping full game price (60$) for the extra stuff as it's a very well polished complete title that is worth that much at least. As they add more things to do, Frames to play as you can go ahead and spend more on it, I won't blame you. However be warned, there is several hundred dollars of content to buy if you don't want to grind out the supplies and Frame blueprints. Warframe is bet played with patience and friends. Everything can be built immediately for Platinum (The real money currency) or bought with it via the market or player trading. It can take up alot of hours to get the characters and weapons if you don't want to spend any money off the bat. Everything aside from the color shcemes can be recieved in game with a bit of time and some higher level friends. Even if you don't know anyone that plays Warframe, there is a chat channel that you can ask to join in on higher level missions to level and get better items and resources from the start. Breakdown: Graphics 9/10 Story 3/10 Gameplay 9/10 Reliability 8/10 Fun 8/10 Value 11/10 Quick Breakdown: Be patient, gets some friends. This is a grindy game if you don't want to spend cash. Amazing graphics, tight gameplay and 90% of the game content only costs time to get.",
          "I recommend this game. Bethesda have desgined and created a true masterpiece. The Elder Scrolls series is some really great lore, the feel it has is so immersive, more so to our own I feel, and I have to say, slightly more so than Tolkiens lore on middle earth. Skyrims feel is no diffrent to the other games in the franchise, altho I must admit I haven't had the pleasure of expieriencing any of them other than a small 1 hour, 1 death play of Morrowind, Skyrim, of course, in fact I believe to have over 2000 hours of gameplay in Skyrim, as I play on the Xbox 360 most of my time, and my fellow brethren allow me to indulge them in some lore and I'll do some roleplay with their character which we don't mind. Oblivion also, I've had many an adventure in the realm of oblivion and Cyrodill, I even have the game manual and every DLC, paid full price as on the XBOX. Probally countless more hours on that game, and I'm definitely familiar with lore in The Elder Scrolls, however, the freedom and power that come with playing and being immersed in an Elder Scrolls game is unlike any other, thanks to bethesda softworks and many other countless reasons :OO: the impact it has on the way at least I think, is significant, makes me want to roleplay,and I shall set out and weave my own fate, :') If you play skyrim, and your rig, whatever you play on. be it laptop, linux I think you can run it on? Mac, anything I guess, if its about the average, I say you definatley should get some mods running with skyrim, it only matters that you have the right and required system/rig, to run it on IF you want graphical mods, or highly increase data and such, otherwise, not so important. You would want to go to Nexus mods and community, on the web, and search on catorgorys for anything your interested in. Also before I tell you what I have, you will need to know how to install mods, if you don't already know, of course if you are unsure of anything you may not want to mess anything up or waste your time to try it, for a great guide on how to do almost everything with mods, search YouTube for Gopher, and watch his video on, well anything, hes a great guy and he explains all you need to know better than most people do that I've seen haha. Hope you get through that alright, and really, if your under 10 years old, which its sort of illegal or breaking some rules if you are, to play the game exetra, you might find it hard to understand, skip things and not do what you need to correctly, causing things to get messy and possibly broken. Don't take shortcuts (follow the guidence/trail) you can ask me anything on the matter too I'd be happy to oblige. Personally I have many* about 50 immersion modifications (mods) and more gameplay effects and changes, also maybe 5 overhauls, one for each, audio, combat, skills, enviroment, gameplay, and a complicated one. Well its a long list of around 600 alltogether modifications, bare in mind that some of theese are about 3kb in size, so i could somehow merge together all the files ive found and downloaded and get to only have 50 or so mods, but not really necesary, with Nexus Mod Manager. Basically, modifications personalise to your dreams and taste, give you what you want and possibly more, there are about 25'000 modifications to be found on the site and many more to come, you can always create and add yourself, Skyrim is endless then and truely magnificicant. If we were to modify older TES games it just wouldnt live up to Skyrim modded as it is down to technology, but can give you endless more time playing with excitement and emotion, and even merging other realms, ooohhh hah (: so much to tell you I could, I guess if you want to know more I'd be a good start to ask on, and your welcome to. It is a great life expierience to explore and adventure Skyrim, turn HUD off at the start if I were you, to be more immersed, and if you will add mods, play through the beggining untill you are 'Unbound' and start to configure, and do not forget to save! Oh that's another thing, if you have more than 4 saves it usuallyy caused loads of problems, like Crash To Desktop and corruption with data, that sort, so limit your saves wisely. Just to say, there is a mod made for Skyrim, for littrally 60% of what ever you think of, and if not, make it :), hardly limmeted, I dont know how to say to people that they should start playing If you, are hungry for adventure, seek the land of Skyrim!

          "----------- For Pros: ----------- Well, after 3 hours of This game is really awesome! I really love the gameplay and the storyline so much. It's like we're playing superhero with an ability to control time. The graphics is mind blowing, but after playing this game for several hours, you will realize that you may know some in-game character are the actor in the real world. There's also some scene in this game use the real movie. For the gameplay, it's almost same with The Division (use cover system on combat against enemy, the different thing is you do not need to press any button to get cover, it will automatically cover your character if you cover on some obstacle), you can loot some weapon and ammo, use a various time ability to kill your enemy or protect yourself, sometimes this game required you to think to get into some place (you will need to use your ability or explore more further), and the most awesome is upgrading system (for your ability). So to upgrade your ability, you need to explore and find something like spirit ball and use it to upgrade your ability. And in my opinion, if you ever play a game like The Last of Us, yeah i dont know why, but this game remind me about The Last of US (maybe because this game use 3rd person camera or the atmosphere). ----------- For Cons: ----------- Believe it or not, but this is some of my PC spesification, CPU: Intel Core I7-6700k GPU: MSI Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Sea Hawk (water cooling GPU) MOBO: ASUStek ROG Maximus Extreme VIII SSD: Samsung 850 EVO 1TB OS: Windows 10 Pro 64bit RAM: Corsair Dominator DDR4 16Gb x 2 (32 Gb) PSU: Corsair HX1000i etc Yes, i use modern high-end gaming But, i played this game using Ultra settings with 1080p resolution and upscaling turned off. I got almost constant 60 FPS (vsync on), but sometimes, the fps drop until 40 FPS (or sometimes constant at 30 FPS). So i tried to turn on the upscaling, and yeah the FPS getting constant in 60 FPS (with vsync), but the graphic will not as great as upscaling turned off. Then i tried to Overclock my GPU a bit, and i got constant 60 FPS, but sometimes still drop to 50 FPS only. So, this game maybe not recommended if you use low-end PC. Some people asked me if this game still playable with medium-end PC or not, and my answer is yes (as long as you got constant 30 FPS or 25-27 FPS for the minimum). For the other cons (based on my opinion), since the begining of the game, i often see the main character or other character got blurred near their body everytime they move (i use ultra settings and got 60 FPS, but the blurred things still happen). I dont know if this is the effect from the game itself or bug or what, but sometimes it makes the game looks not smooth even in 60 FPS. The last thing is, this game is kinda linear for me, you can still explore but not quite. I told you that the story is awesome, but they have the scene that use real movie to watch and it took really long time till we can continue playing the game again (maybe almost 30 mins), it's really like watching a movie (man, i come to play game not watching movie). Well, maybe this game will have a patch to optimize FPS and the graphic in the future. So this is really worth to buy.

          "I recommend this game. Bethesda have desgined and created a true masterpiece. The Elder Scrolls series is some really great lore, the feel it has is so immersive, more so to our own I feel, and I have to say, slightly more so than Tolkiens lore on middle earth. Skyrims feel is no diffrent to the other games in the franchise, altho I must admit I haven't had the pleasure of expieriencing any of them other than a small 1 hour, 1 death play of Morrowind, Skyrim, of course, in fact I believe to have over 2000 hours of gameplay in Skyrim, as I play on the Xbox 360 most of my time, and my fellow brethren allow me to indulge them in some lore and I'll do some roleplay with their character which we don't mind. Oblivion also, I've had many an adventure in the realm of oblivion and Cyrodill, I even have the game manual and every DLC, paid full price as on the XBOX. Probally countless more hours on that game, and I'm definitely familiar with lore in The Elder Scrolls, however, the freedom and power that come with playing and being immersed in an Elder Scrolls game is unlike any other, thanks to bethesda softworks and many other countless reasons :OO: the impact it has on the way at least I think, is significant, makes me want to roleplay,and I shall set out and weave my own fate, :') If you play skyrim, and your rig, whatever you play on. be it laptop, linux I think you can run it on? Mac, anything I guess, if its about the average, I say you definatley should get some mods running with skyrim, it only matters that you have the right and required system/rig, to run it on IF you want graphical mods, or highly increase data and such, otherwise, not so important. You would want to go to Nexus mods and community, on the web, and search on catorgorys for anything your interested in. Also before I tell you what I have, you will need to know how to install mods, if you don't already know, of course if you are unsure of anything you may not want to mess anything up or waste your time to try it, for a great guide on how to do almost everything with mods, search YouTube for Gopher, and watch his video on, well anything, hes a great guy and he explains all you need to know better than most people do that I've seen haha. Hope you get through that alright, and really, if your under 10 years old, which its sort of illegal or breaking some rules if you are, to play the game exetra, you might find it hard to understand, skip things and not do what you need to correctly, causing things to get messy and possibly broken. Don't take shortcuts (follow the guidence/trail) you can ask me anything on the matter too I'd be happy to oblige. Personally I have many* about 50 immersion modifications (mods) and more gameplay effects and changes, also maybe 5 overhauls, one for each, audio, combat, skills, enviroment, gameplay, and a complicated one. Well its a long list of around 600 alltogether modifications, bare in mind that some of theese are about 3kb in size, so i could somehow merge together all the files ive found and downloaded and get to only have 50 or so mods, but not really necesary, with Nexus Mod Manager. Basically, modifications personalise to your dreams and taste, give you what you want and possibly more, there are about 25'000 modifications to be found on the site and many more to come, you can always create and add yourself, Skyrim is endless then and truely magnificicant. If we were to modify older TES games it just wouldnt live up to Skyrim modded as it is down to technology, but can give you endless more time playing with excitement and emotion, and even merging other realms, ooohhh hah (: so much to tell you I could, I guess if you want to know more I'd be a good start to ask on, and your welcome to. It is a great life expierience to explore and adventure Skyrim, turn HUD off at the start if I were you, to be more immersed, and if you will add mods, play through the beggining untill you are 'Unbound' and start to configure, and do not forget to save! Oh that's another thing, if you have more than 4 saves it usuallyy caused loads of problems, like Crash To Desktop and corruption with data, that sort, so limit your saves wisely. Just to say, there is a mod made for Skyrim, for littrally 60% of what ever you think of, and if not, make it :), hardly limmeted, I dont know how to say to people that they should start playing If you, are hungry for adventure, seek the land of Skyrim!

          "----------- For Pros: ----------- Well, after 3 hours of This game is really awesome! I really love the gameplay and the storyline so much. It's like we're playing superhero with an ability to control time. The graphics is mind blowing, but after playing this game for several hours, you will realize that you may know some in-game character are the actor in the real world. There's also some scene in this game use the real movie. For the gameplay, it's almost same with The Division (use cover system on combat against enemy, the different thing is you do not need to press any button to get cover, it will automatically cover your character if you cover on some obstacle), you can loot some weapon and ammo, use a various time ability to kill your enemy or protect yourself, sometimes this game required you to think to get into some place (you will need to use your ability or explore more further), and the most awesome is upgrading system (for your ability). So to upgrade your ability, you need to explore and find something like spirit ball and use it to upgrade your ability. And in my opinion, if you ever play a game like The Last of Us, yeah i dont know why, but this game remind me about The Last of US (maybe because this game use 3rd person camera or the atmosphere). ----------- For Cons: ----------- Believe it or not, but this is some of my PC spesification, CPU: Intel Core I7-6700k GPU: MSI Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 Sea Hawk (water cooling GPU) MOBO: ASUStek ROG Maximus Extreme VIII SSD: Samsung 850 EVO 1TB OS: Windows 10 Pro 64bit RAM: Corsair Dominator DDR4 16Gb x 2 (32 Gb) PSU: Corsair HX1000i etc Yes, i use modern high-end gaming But, i played this game using Ultra settings with 1080p resolution and upscaling turned off. I got almost constant 60 FPS (vsync on), but sometimes, the fps drop until 40 FPS (or sometimes constant at 30 FPS). So i tried to turn on the upscaling, and yeah the FPS getting constant in 60 FPS (with vsync), but the graphic will not as great as upscaling turned off. Then i tried to Overclock my GPU a bit, and i got constant 60 FPS, but sometimes still drop to 50 FPS only. So, this game maybe not recommended if you use low-end PC. Some people asked me if this game still playable with medium-end PC or not, and my answer is yes (as long as you got constant 30 FPS or 25-27 FPS for the minimum).

          "If you're looking for a review that talks about Co-op, this isn't it, haven't tried it out. Enter the Gungeon is a 2D pixel style rogue-lite twin-stick shoots 'em up where you shoot bullets with guns. The enemies are bullets and you shoot them with your gun, that shoots bullets at the bullets, who die despite being Gundead. What I'm trying to say is that the game doesn't take itself too seriously with its setting or theme, but it takes itself incredibly seriously when it comes to gameplay. It's quite damn tough and not a game you should expect to breeze through on your first few (dozen) runs Pros: Excellent controls, if you fail, you don't feel like it's the controls' fault. It's yours. You failed. Mouse+Keyboard and Controller support and they're both really good and feel good, and if they don't, you can rebind them so they do. Nice stylized graphics and effects that run perfectly smoothly, even while there are a ton of bullets on screen. Large variety of power-ups and guns that drastically affect your run and make it different from your previous. The music, while not instantly memorable, is pretty good and usually worth keeping on. Great sound effects. Great map system that allows you to quickly teleport to some cleared rooms. Neutral: Not story heavy. If you're looking for a story-heavy game, this probably isn't for you. Inconsistent tone. This game doesn't take itself too seriously and there isn't any real coherence when it comes to guns. You'll have real-life guns standing on the same level as crazy future laser weapons or just cartoony and wacky guns. Quite a high level of difficulty that might not be for everyone, but might be perfect for others. Puns. You might have guessed that from the title. Runs may take a while to complete/fail to complete. Negatives: Boss fights too long and slightly repetitive. Especially if you haven't picked up some cool gun or have run all out of ammo for it. Reloading feels a bit wonky, might be a personal opinion, but having to press an additional button/the fire button again to reload once your clip is empty feels a bit awkward and it's not always clear if reloading continues happening when you reload and switch guns simultaneously. Adorable enemies. I'd easily recommend this game to people who like The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne (like everyone keeps saying), but i'd also recommend it to anybody who enjoys rogue-lites or difficult games in general. It's really fun and part of the fun is seeing yourself getting better and better and unlocking new things, and I'm totally getting that here. It's a pretty good game and totally worth the full price, since this kind of game can give you hundreds of hours of potential enjoyment and frustration. Score: Bullet Kin United beat Gungeon City 3-1"

          "We are all Thomas. We are all alone, yet we are not alone. We hate others even though we love them, too. When we want to be away from others, we resent the presence of those around us, yet we are never fully at peace when in solitude. Thomas Was Alone is the most introspective puzzle game I've ever played. It isn't really a game, it's something else. In spite of TWA's classification as a puzzle game, it's not really about puzzle solving. It's an experience about solitude, isolation, the fear and sorrows of being alone, as well as the joys and annoyances of being with company. It's about coming to terms with your imperfections and learning to love what makes others unique. Yet it's never ham-fisted about these points. This game's amazing script truly makes you care for these characters and never comes across as being overly sentimental or kitschy. If all you want is a recommendation, I can say wholeheartedly that I do recommend this. Do yourself a favor and go into the game blind; you'll appreciate it more. That being said, I do have a few complaints about the game. There are slight spoilers so read below at your own caution. First of all, the jump ability seems slightly buggy. There's an obvious delay from when you press the jump button to when the character actually jumps; it seems somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of a second, which I found annoying. Also, the game sometimes just won't let you jump. This happened to me on a number of occasions, where I'd run toward the edge of a platform and clearly press the jump button, only to fall to my death. It's quite annoying and seems like it could be easily fixed. Secondly, the balance between puzzle to puzzle is sometimes questionable. Sometimes you'll have a puzzle that takes a long time and is slightly confusing, followed by a very simple one. It seems odd, because normally one expects the puzzles to get gradually harder, which they do for the most part, but every once in a while you get a very easy one to come after a harder one (I'm thinking specifically of the last level, which was ridiculously easy). Thirdly, the game is often quick to drops things it introduces. I'm thinking here of the white diamond shape, which is featured in something like 3 or 4 levels in a row and then completely abandoned. Fourthly, I have to mention achievements. Normally I don't care one way or another about achievements, but here they just made it too easy to get them all. On my first and only playthrough, I got all of them, and I only had to restart a couple levels to get the ones I missed. Almost all of them are obvious and easy to get to. Why didn't they make some more challenging? Speaking of challenge, I didn't find many of the puzzles that difficult. I respect a game whose puzzles are straightforward and unobtuse, but these ones just seemed easy. Some took a while to do, but most were overall very easy. Lastly and most importantly, I have a HUGE complaint about the story. Up until the second to last chapter, the story was very good. Then the final chapter drops almost everything it had been doing up to that point to introduce completely new characters, and a lot of them. The story changes almost entirely for the last bit of the game, which leads to a very abrupt and inconclusive ending without the final characters. It was as if the developers either realized they had to make the game longer or they couldn't figure out how to add the gimmick of the last chapter without those characters. I thought it would've been better if the last section had to utilize all the characters' abilities together in complex ways instead of adding a new aspect at the very end. Overall, this is a very good indie game in spite of the problems I had with it. I especially recommend it to younger players, as it's very kid-friendly and the puzzles seem geared toward kids.",
          "Very short version: Amazing game buy it and play it right now! Short: Great game, the story is fantastic, the combat is really solid and is really fun, the music is good and there is a lot to do so overall get this game espically if you like a good story or fun combat. Normal/long: The story is fantastic there were times i actually got sad and even though the story seems like it is really predictable there are a couple of twists that I never even combat is what you will be doing for the most part but it never got old being able to stun enemies by parrying their attacks leaving them weaker is near over powered when you master it and overall the combat is really fast paced but other then new spells you do not get any new combos which is a little music always in my opinion fits the characters you will be with the most are Dust and Fidget, Dust is a great protaganist if a little bland until later in the game and some people say Fidget is annoying but I do not agree I love Fidget she is one of the best compainions I have ever had to travel bosses are fun and the final boss is one of the best I have fought in a long time nothing in the fight is scripted other then map changes and grapics are great but the main draw is the the art style it is amazing and unique and it is easy to tell between the foreground and background which is more importent the you would think. The last bit length I think if you do all side quest and explore all maps then your are looking at 20-30 hours gameplay which in my opinion is perfect and if you just rush the story I would say just over 10 hours but as I said I think the length is perfect it is long enough to leave you satisfied but not long enough that it feels like it is starting to drag on. Overall get this game it is amazing the charcters, story and amount of content is great and the only real thing I dislike is the lack of new combos and the game goes on."

          "This game is by far amazing. The story, the music, the secrets, the endings. ALL OF IT. It is truly amazing. There are alternate endings and only the good ending has the most CHALLENGING stuff that you will never forget, especially if you are just playing normal mode. What I found it amazing is that not only did i get the good ending, but the progress was really HARD especially on normal mode. It was really worth buying, very great adventure for a platform game. I am seriously rating this 10/10, this is just me but this game is perfect. The tough challenges to go through to beat the game is really great, and I felt great accomplishing it. Further details is that this game also has a level up system which goes up to level 3 max, but its more focused on weapons rather than your character. Its really good. I'm glad I came across this game and decided to buy it, I hope you all consider buying this."

          "Very boring, sadly to say. Though it is an indie game it is not very well Too short and too many cut scenes, and most of them are there for too little reasons. You move too slowly, but I feel like that's what's making the game longer. The puzzles aren't the best they can be, to someone like me they don't have a reason as to why you're doing the puzzles and it feels pointless. Negatives out of the way, the art style is very unique and gives a feeling of mystery. The experience does feel cinematic capped at 60fps, which is great for a game like this. The atmosphere is very good, I love the sounds that you hear and they fit really well with the art style. But there's really no other positives I can think of. Maybe if you have some sort of background, or some kind of interest in signals, you will really like this. But to me, it just seems like there's nothing. But hey, it's an indie game and games take a long time to make, and I guess it's not really aimed at me. So I guess this leads me to giving two seperate scores. For the people who have a background, and are interested in signals maybe, 7/10 (results may vary depending on them, since I am not them c:) For me, it was a So it's a 'play the game for yourself and see if you like it' situation.",

          "As a person who enjoyed parts of the first game but found it to be overall lacking in actual horror, I am glad to say Five Nights 2 exceds the original in almost every way. While I still don't think the game is true horror, it is still fun to play and does a good job of creeping you the player out. READY FOR To those who played the original game and enjoyed it, you will be glad to know that much of what made the first game so popular is present in its sequel. You will once again find yourself as a security guard working the night shift at the newly re-opened Freddy Fazbears's Pizzaria. Much of the gameplay from the first game has been carried over, but with enough changes to make it feel new and not just a rehash of the original. You have a little tablet thing you use the check cameras and keep track of the animatronics as well as a few lights to check the area around you. The first thing you will notice right off the bat is you have no doors this time around, this time you are sitting in front of a wide open hallway and you must use a flashlight you have to light it up in order to check for enemies. There are also two air ducts on either side of you that you must check, giving three possible ways to get in in total. Another thing to note is that there are now six animatronics. Double the Freddy, still not ready. The last new addition is a music box that you have to make sure does not run out. WHO GOES THERE? As fun as the game is, it does have a few problems. For example, after night one the charge on the music box begins to drop faster and faster which adds to the tension. The problem is, because you have the music box to deal with as well as checking the vents and the hallway in front of you, you might as well keep your camera set on the room with the music box. The rest of the cameras become pretty much useless. And then there is the damn balloon boy, who will enter your room and start laughing without end thus rendering your lights useless and calling the attention of all of the animatronics (mainly Foxy). As of this moment I have no idea how to deal with the balloon boy, but he is super annoying and only serves to frustrate me instead of making the game more scary. The moment he appears in your room you might as well start over, because there is just no way of dealing with him that I am aware of. Not only that, but the game suffers from problems that the first game had as well. Because you're pretty much doing the same thing over and over again, there is a lack of replayability for you can only do the same thing over and over so many times before it gets dull. DARK All in all, Five Nights 2 is a fun game that surpasses the original in almost every way and should offer a few good jumps to those that play it. It might not be the best horror game ever, and it doesn't even come close to such masterpieces as Silent Hill 2 or Amnesia, but it does show that the horror genre still has life left in it and I will take it over games like Resident Evil 6 any day. Peace and cupcakes, Pyrin",
          "The game's plot is quite simple - you need to find your sister, and you face a lot of obstacles and puzzles that you must overcome. All fans of puzzles should definitely buy this game. + Atmosphere + Gameplay + Puzzles There are no cons, and i don't want to find them. This is a great game, 10/10"

          "First off, words can not describe how excited and happy I was when I saw that this game was finally released on Steam! I had seen game videos on Youtube for this game, and knew that this was the game for me. So, after buying it on Steam and playing for some time, I released that this game has a ton of potential. First off, City Car Driving is not necessarily a game! It is meant more as a driver's education type learning tool. (Although, I bought it as a game, and continue to play it as a game) :D City Car Driving is one of the very few games that has the following features: Parking Brake Seatbelts Turn Signals Horn Stop Lights and Signs Police Officers to Direct Traffic Smart AI that can be changed to more aggressive Windshield Wipers And almost everything else that can be seen in the real world Also, this game can even run on my PC with no problems! I have a Dell Inspiron 3520 with 8GB of ram, and HD4000 512MB Video Card, and an i5 processor After changing some video settings to medium-low, I have no problem running the game. Another awesome thing is mods. You can choose almost any car you could think of to drive. Now, you used to have to check all kinds of websites that weren't even in your language to find the mod you were looking for, but now, all you have to so is download them from the Steam Workshop! Now, to some very few negatives: First off, I was very dissapointed to see that this game does not support Xbox 360 controllers. I am in no financial state to buy a wheel, so the controller is vital for me. This is my most major problem, and I hope the developers fix it soon, as I am not the only person with this problem. Also, it would be nice if there was tire smoke and tracks. Next, this is more of a suggestion, but a working fuel system would be cool. :D That's about it! If you are looking for a super realistic driving simulator, look no further! This is the one for you! I bought it during Steam's Winter Sale for "

          "I highly recommend people to get The Crew if they like arcade like racing, fast cars, customization, and openworld driving. This game gets a lot of hate and people begin to compare it to games like Forza Horizon, NFS, Burnout, and Test Drive Unlimited 2 and also begin to compare to the 2 top racing simulators like Forza and Gran Turismo. I think people forget that this is not a full on simulator, this is a arcade type game where jumping things at 150 mph wont destroy your car. The Crew features about 40 cars with maybe 10 more coming on the way with DLC and there are 5 car spec's that you can chose from. Street, Dirt, Perf, Raid and Curcuit. You unlock each of those 5 specs as you play the game and level up and not all cars are able to have all 5 specs for example, A lambo only has Perf and Curcuit, a Dodge Charger only allowes Street, Dirt and Perf and so on for most of the cars. For customizing you are only allowed to customize Street, Dirt, and Perf spec cars and each car for each spec has its own uniqe customization options but the Raid and Curcuit spec cars are already preset to a certain look and it cannot be change expect for the color, stickers (as they call it), rims, and the interior. The game covers the whole USA but made into a small version to fit the game. You can get from New York to San Francisco in about 40 minutes - 1 hour. Some citys have been included but not made fully to scale as that would probably be impossible to do and would take too much time to do everything to scale so what is included in the cities is enough to make it recognizable. The story is a simple story that is not so original but then again what can be done with a racing game? You are framed for murdering your brother when someone from the inside killed him with the help of a dirty fbi cop. So you are sent to jail and are offered to go undercover to seek revenge for the murder of your brother. There are microtransactions in the game but it is useless because you still need to unlock every part to own it and cars are not that hard to buy with ingame money. I remember seeing that the Devs said they took actual car sounds from the actual car but that is not true. Every car sounds generic but at least each car has a different pitch and sound to it. Pros: +Car customization +The whole US to explore +Can play the whole game with 3 friends +5 secret cars to unlock +Everything can be purchased with ingame money +Every car has a different sound, even though non of them are the actual car sounds its enough for each car to have its own sound +each car has its own detailed interior Cons: -Only 40 cars to chose from -Lack of asian cars to chose from (only 2) -Police are a bit too aggressive -Skill Challenges get really repetative -Cheaters, no chance to gain a world record on any challenge -No working rear view mirrors -Microtransactions",

Plays on 3770k w/ 770 SLI with all settings maxed out at 60+ FPS, very smooth. No crashes, no issues here. The story is short, but thats to be expected as this is a preview for Phantom Pain. However there are side missions, challenges and Steam achievements that keep replayability high. Controls can take a little getting used to if your playing with keyboard/mouse. Also has full gamepad support, but playing with the mouse is alot of fun and makes looking around and aiming alot more fun. I own the PS4 version, and I much prefer the PC version.

I highly recommend not purchasing this game unless you've had no problems connecting to UPlay for other games. If the Steam moderators are listening to your customers' voices, please break away from Ubisoft. Thanks.

          "Sonic Generations is a huge tribute to the most popular Sonic game, you can have both the old school sonic and the modern sonic styles of game and the most remembered scenarios and songs from previous Sonic games also has a lot of great artwork, unfortunately has several bugs and i don't recommend you to complete all the is too hard with those bugs Gameplay 8/10 I loved the gameplay, you will have 9 scenarios over 2 acts, these scenarios are map inspired and almost the same from Sonic 1, 2, 3, Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic Adventure 1 & 2, Sonic The Hedgehog, Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors. Can seem that are not many maps, but you can play also over 90 challenges. Classic Sonic mode: is the classic platform mode, when you clear the challenges you can use the Electric, Fire, Bubble and Sonic 1 shields. Modern Sonic mode: is a third person mode, in which sonic can lock and hit targets and use Turbo, the third person perspective switches with a platform in several part of each map. The only thing i hate was the final boss fight, i didn't get anthing that was going to much effects weird and also for me there was several maps in modern sonic that were tricky and confusing but if you play Sonic Adventure previously, this probably won't be an issue. The difficulty of the game is up to you, you can try to get S in all the stages, and make all the challenges, or simply pass the story, but all the boss fights are very like in every Sonic games the boss has simple patterns. I took me 29 hours to unlock all the Achievements, because of a bug took me some hours to figure it out. Just plaing the story with cinematics can be done in 5, you are forced to play some challenges to unlock the new stages. Graphics 9/10 The graphics are pretty descent the only problem is playing using Steam Streaming, i tried but for some reason the image capture of Steam was too slow and couldn't play it that way. And the 2d to 3d charater transformation were great. Sound & Music 9/10 The music and sounds are from the previous Sonic games but with a loot of more quality, brings my childhood back each time i hear the Sonic spins, hits fire shield sounds etc. I think the sound work is awesome. Bugs & stability 5/10 Several times i found bugs, like the Ranked Attack maps crashes every i could find how to 'skip' the bug but also has a lot of work and very Some scenarios had a few parts with bad collision but almost never caused me getting kill. Total 7/10 I totally recommend you this game if you love classics Sega Genesis Sonic i guarantee that you will enjoy it and bring your childhood back a couple of hours. I hope this review were useful to you and tanks for reading. Regards!"

          "Dishonored is a first person stealth action game were you play as Corvo Attano. He is the bodyguard of the Empress of the Isles but you are framed for her murder and now have to become an assassin to seek revenge and save her daughter who was kidnapped in the process. You are freed from prison by the Loyalists who are a resistance group that seek to take the city of Dunwall back. Your first night out you are visited by a mysterious character called The Outsider while you sleep. He burns his mark on your hand and imbues you with special powers to help you through your missions. These missions can be completed in a variety of ways. You can sneak through all the levels without killing anyone or go ahead and kill them all. Why not try a little of both if you feel like it. The only thing is the more you kill the more chaos will ensue. With more chaos you\u2019ll see more rats and more plagued citizens. There are also small side missions you can complete to earn other goodies to help you out. Your weapons consist of a small sword, a crossbow, or your bare hands which can silently take out your enemies or help you in moments of confrontation. Another thing you can do is peek through keyholes to see what may be on the other side which can help you choose how you will accomplish things. You are also given a choice of ten supernatural powers which five are active and five are passive. You will need to find runes to unlock more powers or upgrade them. There are also 40 different bone charms to help enhance your powers or abilities. The supporting cast were well voiced and had many likable and unlikable characters. Everyone was well voiced which always helps add to the immersion. The story was pretty good but I just never really understood what the whole purpose of the Outsider was. I\u2019m not sure if I missed something in the end but I felt all he really did was give you some powers and then never explain why. I also felt a there really wasn\u2019t much to see since most of the game was basically in one area. Overall Dishonored was a great game to play and would love to see a sequel perhaps that may explain more about the Outsider. Maybe even add more missions to flesh the game out some more just not ones that make it feel like it\u2019s just filler. If you haven\u2019t played Dishonored yet then now is the time since the game can be picked up for cheap and it\u2019s worth the money. Bear Rating: 9/10",
          "Dishonored 2 throws you 15 years after the events of Dishonored, where you get to choose to play as either Emily Kaldwin, or her father, Corvo Attano, in a fight to reclaim the throne from usurper Delilah Kaldwin, long long sister to previous Empress, Jessamine Kaldwin. The gameplay has been improved upon immensely from the previous game, with a new bonecrafting system and spell upgrades, this game will always keep you actively wanting to find materials and runes to improve them. The combat is very fluid and has improved slightly since the previous game. There's a lot more interesting animations for killing people now. They also improved upon the cover system, which is awesome. The story is short, maybe around 2 hrs per mission, but with a lot of content and side quests blooming within these missions, you will always be questioning if you should be looking for side quests or jumping into the action. Now even though the story is short, it isn't entirely bad. It plays out almost exactly as you think it would but the world of Dishonored has all these different choices and outcomes that it's not dull. Playing as Emily Kaldwin. My first play through with Emily Kaldwin was so much fun, all her different abilities really made the game feel different when compared to my Corvo play through, who isn't given any new abilities. Emily's far reach is probably the best spell in the game, it has so much potential. You can use it like blink to get to places you can't normally get, you can pull items from above for stealth play through, and also you can pull enemies to either incapacitate or kill. I enjoyed my Emily playthrough immensely and can't wait to jump back on her for another one. Now I know a lot of people have had performance issues with this game, I fortunately didn't really have any. I tinkered my settings a lot to find the best combination (Pre beta patches). The only time I had an issue was the timetravel map, but I assume a lot of people would of. Anyways, I was fortunate enough to play it without issues. I highly recommend this game, it's an amazing sequel to an amazing original game. Cheers, \u00b7 \u30c4 \u2020"

          "I finally got around to beating this game and wow the story and lore behind this game is high quality. Gameplay: Dishonored is a stealth action game in which you try and complete missions depending on the players play style. You can cause chaos to complete your missions or take the stealth path, this involves setting traps and trying to be undetected. As Corvo you have unique powers such as Blink, a powerup in which you can teleport from place to place. There are more powers you can unlock later on the game using Runes, I will not spoil what the others are. Story (Without Spoilers Of Course) Corvo is a bodyguard of the empress until one day he was framed of killing her. Its up to you to avenge her death. (Thats as basic as I get) Pros: -Unique Stealth Combat -An engaging story with interesting characters. -Powers that are cool. :) Cons: -Rage -(JK about the first one) -No Cons ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)",

          "I am writing this review due to the release of Dishonored 2 in five days. I am writing this solely off of the main game, considering that I do not have the DLC packs. Dishonored is a first person stealth and action based game set in a steampunk universe. You play the role of Corvo Attano, a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and mistakingly accused of murdering the Empress. You will encounter many types of levels, all ripe with a wide variety of ways to accomplish the mission. Each level is filled with interesting characters that have unique dialogue options ('Shall we gather for whiskey and cigars tonight?'). Corvo has a large arsenal of weapons that range from his trusty sword to a pistol, all of which can be upgraded to your liking. On top of the standard weapons, there are also supernatural abilities. These powers add a new level of creativity to an already stellar game. Just like the weapons, they can be upgraded in whichever way the player chooses. The story takes place in the city of Dunwall, an environment that is battling the rat plague. The environment that you explore will reveal the past of Dunwall and give you insight into individual's lives and how they endure the plague. The one thing that many people worry about on the PC is graphics and optimization. I am happy to say that this game passes with flying colors in both sections. The graphics are absolutely stellar considering it being released in 2012. You will also have no trouble running this game because the requirements are not demanding. With all of this in mind, Dishonored is an amazing game. It is absolutely worth the $10 that the game is set at right now. Dishonored 2 comes out November 11th, 2016 and I would highly recommend buying Dishonored and playing it. If you want to save money, you can Dishonored 2 before it comes out and obtain access to Dishonored Definitive Edition which has all available DLC. Dishonored easily earns a 10/10.",
          "Set 15 years after the events of Dishonored, this game tells the story of the empress, Emily Kaldwin, and her father, Corvo Attano. Emily is unexpectedly overthrown by the Duke of Serkonos and his servants. You get to play as either Emily or Corvo and attempt to reclaim the throne. The story takes place in Dunwall and Karnaca. Karnaca is a new location in the Dishonored series and is home to the Duke. Throughout the game, you try to take down those in power and reclaim your rightful position. To begin with, the PC version of this game has some issues. Performance was horrible at launch and has since gotten better. It is still not perfect. I have a mid-end system and managed to play through it at 30-60 fps on a mix of low/medium settings. Do not expect amazing performance unless you have an absolute beast of a PC. I still experience a lot of FPS dips. I would suggest buying this game on consoles if you can. HOWEVER, I highly recommend that you give this game a chance. If you liked the first game, then I have no doubt this will feel familiar and even more expansive. Every aspect of the first game is here and has been greatly improved. It is a bigger and a bolder version. The world is remarkable and densely packed with secrets and collectables. There are notes, diaries, maps, bone charms, relics, safes, loot, audio logs, and much more. There are a ton of side stories and other material that can all be discovered. Even though the experience only has nine main missions, the amount of replay-ability and exploration is insane. With two protagonists, a new game + mode, tons of powers, upgrade trees, and different weapons it is easy to want to start a second run. It is all up to the player to make Dishonored 2 their own experience. Not every aspect of this game is perfect but you have the choice to do what you want. That is what makes this game so great.

          "Another AAA game released in an unfinished state. But it's arguably playable now with beta update If you don't know already, Dishonored 2 is a first-person stealth/action game designed to be equally proficient as a stealth game and an action game. You can finish the game without ever getting detected and without ever engaging in combat, or you can do the opposite. Levels are sprawling and non-linear but overall story progression is linear. It features two selectable protagonists, each with unique powers (which are like spells). Finishing Dishonored and its two story expansions (The Knife of Dunwall and Brigmore Witches) is an absolute necessity, since most of the character exposition and development for Dishonored 2's characters actually relies on those. Which is a knock against Dishonored 2 by the way. Plus, Dishonored is an incredible game, better than this one all around and still gorgeous, so don't even think about starting this franchise with the sequel. The most annoying issues are the graphics glitches; shadows popping/flickering, ambient occlusion glow, some texture flickering. Performance has improved a lot with this update but it isn't where it should be, especially with the frame pacing issues that persist. At 2560 x 1440 on an overclocked GTX 1080, i7 6700k @ GHz, and 16GB DDR4 3000 MHz RAM I average 75-100 FPS outdoors now (but some places in Karnaca go below that) and oddly enough 65-90 FPS indoors. Frame pacing issues exist at all frame rates, but less consistently at 120 FPS on the dot. Audio has some glitches like voices outputting to non-existent surround channels on systems, or voices disappearing when turning away from them even on surround setups surround here). AI has navigation issues. Some clipping issues remain. Level design is incomplete since in some places you can see in between the tiles. Technicalities aside, I am happy to report that Dishonored 2 retains the amazing art style from the first. Levels are bigger and more open than ever before with so many ways to advance and approach objectives. Although it may have fewer unique environments than the first, and decals like graffiti and propaganda are far more repetitive. On that note, readable texts around the world are more repetitive as well; it seems this game has less of them than the first. Gameplay mechanics are almost perfect. Very similar to the first, improved melee combat responsiveness and a few new features like countering after perfectly timed blocks. In direct combat you can now grab a hold of someone and use them as a shield, choking them out in the process but you can throw them in front of you which is useful against groups of enemies. For some reason leaning is toggle only. Crouching is toggle only and is oddly laggy. AI is improved and has better detection than virtually every other stealth game at least on hard mode or harder. Creatures actually see out of their eyes, they react more quickly to detections, and there's no 'If I see you then everyone else sees you' garbage. Due to the non-linear level design, the ability to climb any and all ledges (no contextual crap like 2014's Thief atrocity), environmental interaction (which could be better), the fact that light/shadows affect concealment, and the powers if you choose to accept them, Dishonored 2 like the first game are on a different level than every other modern stealth game of its kind. Only the classic Thief games can compete. Corvo's powers are the same as the first but with more upgrades, so they're all awesome. Emily also has incredible powers, more geared toward stealth though. The story is complete mediocrity compared to the first. It hardly has any characters, and all characters, factions/groups, and plot events and devices do not have nearly enough exposition. Dialogue is generic and utterly unremarkable. The story was clearly rushed. So Dishonored 2 is far from a perfect sequel. Technically it is still a mess, the story is very disappointing, but the art design is remarkable and the gameplay fluidity/smoothness and fun factor are to die for. Wait for it to be complete, all patched up, and then buy it. But remember, you MUST finish Dishonored, Dishonored: The Knife of Dunwall, and Dishonored: Brigmore Witches before playing this one. Especially with Dishonored 2's lack of character development and exposition, seemingly relying on playing the first game and expansions to the first game.",
          "I liked Dishonored. That's about as far as I get in my opinion of it. I'm finding it hard to formulate a more complex opinion of it because the game itself is not very complex. There were some things I liked and some things I didn't, all evening out to a even experience. There was more good than bad, so this gets a positive review but I should probably talk about all the things I like and didn't like or this won't be much of a review. The game play sports some of the better designed stealth mechanics in the genre. Clearly defined visibility and reasonable movement speed, especially when crouched, provide a solid core for the game to build around. Your powers evolve the game into a rewarding experience: the ability to teleport allows for creative solutions to problems. The ability to see through walls is great for planning your next move and adapting your strategy to changes in the situation; even if it does diminish any sense of tension and takes away from art design by making you decide whether to leave it on all the time or not. Some powers are more valuable than others however and are even redundant. The powers that upgrade your physical capabilities and health are incredibly valuable while the one governing your adrenaline is entirely needless as it defeats the point of being stealthy. The ability to turn your victims to dust to prevent their bodies from being discovered is outclassed by the ability to summon a swarm of rats, which eat bodies and also attack enemies. I never bothered with the ability to possess animals or people as it was easier and more rewarding to dispatch them with the abilities I already had. The power to slow or stop time is nice for dismantling a complex situation all at once and the ability to fire a blast of wind is worthless without being fully upgraded because it either does nothing or outright kills the targets; which may not be what you want if you're trying to be non-lethal. You have a variety of weapons to choose from but only half of them facilitate stealth, Your sword and crossbow being the only examples. A pistol and grenades are also available but both make noise and alert guards. I never ended up using the grenades but the pistol was useful early on for finishing off singular guards. So too was the crossbow however and only one didn't make noise. Ultimately the game is meant to be played with a certain pace and anything slower than that is liable to feel sticky and unintuitive. Getting caught isn't the end of the world though and I really liked that. If you are spotted you can fight your way out fairly intuitively and take to the rafters to resume the stealthing. The setting is interesting and I enjoyed exploring its facets. Set in a steam punk allegory for London, a deadly disease (a black plague allusion) is killing huge swaths of the population. You play as Corvo, personal bodyguard to the queen of Not-England and father figure to her daughter, the princess, who's real father is never mentioned nor is the idea of her conception explored. Upon returning home to your surrogate family, the queen is murdered by assassins and the princess is kidnapped, leading me to assume Corvo was not the valedictorian of bodyguard school. Corvo is framed for the crime and sentenced to death, but not before being held captive by the villanously bald spymaster who has become Nazi dictator of Not-England because apparently he was next in line to rule. After making his daring escape from prison, Corvo is inducted into the secret resistance to overthrow bald Hitler comprising a bunch of high ranking dudes from the government who then proceed to have Corvo do literally almost everything while they sit at the bar of their secret base and drink. Corvo is a silent protagonist anyway, so it's not like he had anything meaningful to contribute. The problem I had with the plot is that the characters are aggressively one-dimensional and might as well scrawl their secret plans on the wall with crayon. Everything they do is taken right out of a plot-by-numbers book and if you can't see the surprise twist coming then you must be blind AND deaf, because even if you can't see, every character might as well publicize their intentions with a megaphone. There are two endings to the game, one for players who took all the good options and one for players who took the bad, so we can add binary moral choice to the pile of anchors that weigh down the story. Not that you can tell, I think I got the bad ending but I wasn't sure because it consisted of a grossly cryptic monolog that didn't explained anything. In the end, the game's length can make up for having to play through twice to get both endings and ultimately I can recommend Dishonored for the stealth but not for the story. The good balanced out the bad in a way that makes this game a good purchase on sale, but only on sale."

          "Another AAA game released in an unfinished state. But it's arguably playable now with beta update If you don't know already, Dishonored 2 is a first-person stealth/action game designed to be equally proficient as a stealth game and an action game. You can finish the game without ever getting detected and without ever engaging in combat, or you can do the opposite. Levels are sprawling and non-linear but overall story progression is linear. It features two selectable protagonists, each with unique powers (which are like spells). Finishing Dishonored and its two story expansions (The Knife of Dunwall and Brigmore Witches) is an absolute necessity, since most of the character exposition and development for Dishonored 2's characters actually relies on those. Which is a knock against Dishonored 2 by the way. Plus, Dishonored is an incredible game, better than this one all around and still gorgeous, so don't even think about starting this franchise with the sequel. The most annoying issues are the graphics glitches; shadows popping/flickering, ambient occlusion glow, some texture flickering. Performance has improved a lot with this update but it isn't where it should be, especially with the frame pacing issues that persist. At 2560 x 1440 on an overclocked GTX 1080, i7 6700k @ GHz, and 16GB DDR4 3000 MHz RAM I average 75-100 FPS outdoors now (but some places in Karnaca go below that) and oddly enough 65-90 FPS indoors. Frame pacing issues exist at all frame rates, but less consistently at 120 FPS on the dot. Audio has some glitches like voices outputting to non-existent surround channels on systems, or voices disappearing when turning away from them even on surround setups surround here). AI has navigation issues. Some clipping issues remain. Level design is incomplete since in some places you can see in between the tiles. Technicalities aside, I am happy to report that Dishonored 2 retains the amazing art style from the first. Levels are bigger and more open than ever before with so many ways to advance and approach objectives. Although it may have fewer unique environments than the first, and decals like graffiti and propaganda are far more repetitive. On that note, readable texts around the world are more repetitive as well; it seems this game has less of them than the first. Gameplay mechanics are almost perfect. Very similar to the first, improved melee combat responsiveness and a few new features like countering after perfectly timed blocks. In direct combat you can now grab a hold of someone and use them as a shield, choking them out in the process but you can throw them in front of you which is useful against groups of enemies. For some reason leaning is toggle only. Crouching is toggle only and is oddly laggy. AI is improved and has better detection than virtually every other stealth game at least on hard mode or harder. Creatures actually see out of their eyes, they react more quickly to detections, and there's no 'If I see you then everyone else sees you' garbage. Due to the non-linear level design, the ability to climb any and all ledges (no contextual crap like 2014's Thief atrocity), environmental interaction (which could be better), the fact that light/shadows affect concealment, and the powers if you choose to accept them, Dishonored 2 like the first game are on a different level than every other modern stealth game of its kind. Only the classic Thief games can compete. Corvo's powers are the same as the first but with more upgrades, so they're all awesome. Emily also has incredible powers, more geared toward stealth though. The story is complete mediocrity compared to the first. It hardly has any characters, and all characters, factions/groups, and plot events and devices do not have nearly enough exposition. Dialogue is generic and utterly unremarkable. The story was clearly rushed. So Dishonored 2 is far from a perfect sequel. Technically it is still a mess, the story is very disappointing, but the art design is remarkable and the gameplay fluidity/smoothness and fun factor are to die for. Wait for it to be complete, all patched up, and then buy it. But remember, you MUST finish Dishonored, Dishonored: The Knife of Dunwall, and Dishonored: Brigmore Witches before playing this one. Especially with Dishonored 2's lack of character development and exposition, seemingly relying on playing the first game and expansions to the first game.",
          "I liked Dishonored. That's about as far as I get in my opinion of it. I'm finding it hard to formulate a more complex opinion of it because the game itself is not very complex. There were some things I liked and some things I didn't, all evening out to a even experience. There was more good than bad, so this gets a positive review but I should probably talk about all the things I like and didn't like or this won't be much of a review. The game play sports some of the better designed stealth mechanics in the genre. Clearly defined visibility and reasonable movement speed, especially when crouched, provide a solid core for the game to build around. Your powers evolve the game into a rewarding experience: the ability to teleport allows for creative solutions to problems. The ability to see through walls is great for planning your next move and adapting your strategy to changes in the situation; even if it does diminish any sense of tension and takes away from art design by making you decide whether to leave it on all the time or not. Some powers are more valuable than others however and are even redundant. The powers that upgrade your physical capabilities and health are incredibly valuable while the one governing your adrenaline is entirely needless as it defeats the point of being stealthy. The ability to turn your victims to dust to prevent their bodies from being discovered is outclassed by the ability to summon a swarm of rats, which eat bodies and also attack enemies. I never bothered with the ability to possess animals or people as it was easier and more rewarding to dispatch them with the abilities I already had. The power to slow or stop time is nice for dismantling a complex situation all at once and the ability to fire a blast of wind is worthless without being fully upgraded because it either does nothing or outright kills the targets; which may not be what you want if you're trying to be non-lethal. You have a variety of weapons to choose from but only half of them facilitate stealth, Your sword and crossbow being the only examples. A pistol and grenades are also available but both make noise and alert guards. I never ended up using the grenades but the pistol was useful early on for finishing off singular guards. So too was the crossbow however and only one didn't make noise. Ultimately the game is meant to be played with a certain pace and anything slower than that is liable to feel sticky and unintuitive. Getting caught isn't the end of the world though and I really liked that. If you are spotted you can fight your way out fairly intuitively and take to the rafters to resume the stealthing. The setting is interesting and I enjoyed exploring its facets. Set in a steam punk allegory for London, a deadly disease (a black plague allusion) is killing huge swaths of the population. You play as Corvo, personal bodyguard to the queen of Not-England and father figure to her daughter, the princess, who's real father is never mentioned nor is the idea of her conception explored. Upon returning home to your surrogate family, the queen is murdered by assassins and the princess is kidnapped, leading me to assume Corvo was not the valedictorian of bodyguard school. Corvo is framed for the crime and sentenced to death, but not before being held captive by the villanously bald spymaster who has become Nazi dictator of Not-England because apparently he was next in line to rule. After making his daring escape from prison, Corvo is inducted into the secret resistance to overthrow bald Hitler comprising a bunch of high ranking dudes from the government who then proceed to have Corvo do literally almost everything while they sit at the bar of their secret base and drink. Corvo is a silent protagonist anyway, so it's not like he had anything meaningful to contribute. The problem I had with the plot is that the characters are aggressively one-dimensional and might as well scrawl their secret plans on the wall with crayon. Everything they do is taken right out of a plot-by-numbers book and if you can't see the surprise twist coming then you must be blind AND deaf, because even if you can't see, every character might as well publicize their intentions with a megaphone. There are two endings to the game, one for players who took all the good options and one for players who took the bad, so we can add binary moral choice to the pile of anchors that weigh down the story. Not that you can tell, I think I got the bad ending but I wasn't sure because it consisted of a grossly cryptic monolog that didn't explained anything. In the end, the game's length can make up for having to play through twice to get both endings and ultimately I can recommend Dishonored for the stealth but not for the story.
