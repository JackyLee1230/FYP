          "enjoyable!!!! the game has a very nice way of making you feel completely powerless, afraid and alone, whilst at the same time giving you an poverwhelming sense of freedom. i ' ve made the mistake a few times of fighting a pack of zombies, and then realising about 30 seconds later that it was the worst mistake ever and running away. and as for the night time!? terrifying, pitch black and full of scary, 10 / 10, highly"
