       "     'default, the player can rewind time in each world, but each world has its own special mechanics that also deal with time. the player has to solve puzzles using this time mechanic, often with some precision platforming. each of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, but the levels are designed such that the player can walk past a puzzle to solve it later. some of the level designs are repeated in this game, but with new twists to be used with a new time based mechanic. the time based mechanics of braid are amazing for solving the tricky puzzles while also being cool yet confusing when thinking about how some of the mechanics work. although some of the puzzles can be a pain to figure out or time well with precise actions, braid tends to be a short game at 5 hours, and maybe more if players are really stuck on some puzzles. braid has its strong and unique puzzle gameplay while having good design and a story to think about. while the puzzles may be hard at times and the story a bit strange, this is a great indie title to check out and play for the different things it brings in the game.'],\n",

       "    'default, the player can rewind time in each world, but each world has its own special mechanics that also deal with time. the player has to solve puzzles using this time mechanic, often with some precision platforming. each of the puzzles can be difficult to solve, but the levels are designed such that the player can walk past a puzzle to solve it later. some of the level designs are repeated in this game, but with new twists to be used with a new time based mechanic. the time based mechanics of braid are amazing for solving the tricky puzzles while also being cool yet confusing when thinking about how some of the mechanics work. although some of the puzzles can be a pain to figure out or time well with precise actions, braid tends to be a short game at 5 hours, and maybe more if players are really stuck on some puzzles. braid has its strong and unique puzzle gameplay while having good design and a story to think about. while the puzzles may be hard at times and the story a bit strange, this is a great indie title to check out and play for the different things it brings in the game.'],\n",
