      "Original: After having played almost 60 hours in the first 4 days since release I think I'm in the position to give some first impressions. And yes I call it first impressions because I'm taking it slow and I feel like after 60 hours I only scratched the surface of this game for what will probably take me 200 hours to complete. \n",
      "\n",
      "The graphics range from breathtaking to disappointing. For the most part, the graphics look fantastic and some of the environments and planets just look amazing and the lighting is done really well in the game. There are are places which really do not look good at all. One would be the big city of New Atlantis which is one of the first places you will visit in the game. Don't be put off by that, the other bigger settlements/cities look significantly better visually.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing you need to know about is what this game is and what it isn't. This game isn't a space sim. You will spend very little time in your ship and most time on planets. There is a bit of space combat but that's pretty much all there is in space. You can do some piracy but that's about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game is an RPG in the first place, think of it like a mix between Fallout 4 and Mass Effect with a bit of No Man's Sky sprinkled in. If you are familiar with other games from Bethesda, this is what you get. Traversal between different systems, landing on planets, going from planet to planet etc. are all divided by loading screens/cutscenes. There is no free form travel between planets like in space sims like Elite Dangerous or No Man's Sky. But this is not a problem if you see the game similar to Mass Effect and as an RPG. You may be annoyed by this limitation at first, but after you played for a while you will understand why it's better this way. You really DO NOT want to spend hours travelling from system to system and planet to planet just to go to quest locations or turn in a quest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Landing on planets anywhere creates a map that has boundaries as you most likely know by now. This is NOT an issue in my opinion. After 50 hours I haven't run into any boundary yet. The maps generated when you land are huge. Unless you are bee-lining straight for the boundary, walking 30 minutes (or however long it takes) into the same direction then you won't ever see the boundary message. You will have reasons to go to a planet for missions or when exploring you will be distracted by all the POI that you can find and will investigate. By the time you would come even anywhere close to a boundary you will probably have already left the planet to go elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manual modular ship building is simply amazing and the best I have seen in any game so far. So many hours I could spend just in the ship builder alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The base building is fun and you can unlock additional stuff to build via the research station. The base building is purely optional just like in Fallout 4. You can do it as a side activity for fun if you want, but there is no need to do it or any particular advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The story so far feels good to me, but I'm still too early in the game to tell (yeah after 50 hours, I know). The game is probably the biggest game of Bethesda yet in terms of content as there are quests everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of bugs I feel the game is very polished, especially for a game from Bethesda. I haven't noticed any significant bugs yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few things here and there that could be improved, like the main cities not having a map to see where everything is. The ship building is fun but it's a bit clunky, they could have improved the UI and building process for it. Some things are a bit unclear or easy to miss, like that you can set a preference on taking of your helmet and space suit automatically in breathable locations or settlements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a great game that I will spend possibly hundreds of hours in until I even think about adding mods. This is just my personal subjective review which I believe is very different from people who did not enjoy the game. The motivational curve only points up so far. The game get's more addicting the more I play. After 60 hours I don't feel like \"is there anything left to do?\" but rather overwhelmed like \"Oh my god, there is still so much to do, I feel like I have barely started, this is great!\".

      "\n",
      "Combat balance is a complete joke. It doesn't feel like anyone was paying attention to it. There are whole skill families so ineffective that it undermines the idea of progression choice. For instance I started playing as unarmed for the hell of it. I've invested all my points towards that goal and with no points in firearms they are far far more effective. It's thoughtless and lazy. Very disappointing. Just put your points in the standard sneaky ranged character. You'll have fun and won't waste points.\n",

      "There are a ton of folks that really riding the hype train on this but the game is actually really rough around the edges in ways that are pretty astounding. I'm still intending to keep playing but I don't think I'd recommend this to folks until a few patches in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review outlets giving this game nearly perfect scores are discrediting themselves. Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying myself but the game doesn't feel as cohesive as Skyrim or Fallout. I do not expect Starfield to become Bethesda new gold standard. If Skyrim is great, Starfield is good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game doesn't quiet know who it is. We've heard a lot of marketing talking about \"10 years of development\" and I think they've maybe overplayed that hand. It's like bragging to your teacher you spent all month on your paper as you turn in B+ work. \n",

      "Skyrim/Fallout + No Man's Sky is about the right vibe.\n",

      "The shooting is considerably better than Fallout 3/4/76 but considerably worse than industry standard. It's functional and fun.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pointless inventory weight limits that don't have any functional effect on game play difficulty. They just waste time. Bethesda is living in the past with this design choice. I can still carry a ton of weapons and healing packs. Running out of inventory space just interrupts the fun and causes tedium. Time to join us in 2023 Bethesda. MAYBE it matters later in the game for trading? Maybe? Even if you consider inventory limits necessary for this game there's still a ton of wasted time due to bad UI design choices. They need to either due away with these inventory limits or make it MUCH less time and input intensive to deal with it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The criticism surrounding the game's slow start is 100% dead on. It easily has the weakest initial 30-60 minutes of any Bethesda RPG by a huge margin. It's jarring, confusing, poorly written and slow. They really should've stuck with the mysterious prisoner bit. I'm about 10hrs in and only now have i started to feel oriented and on track.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the planets I've come across have huge expanses of open empty terrain you have to run across to get to the next interesting thing to do. There's no lack of things to catch your interest but my thumb has started aching from holding down the left thumbstick. They really need to fix this. It's so bad I'd call it unprofessional. It makes me wonder if the design leadership actually played this game at all? Give me a speeder bike or something for fuck sake. If not that make boost packs worth using for long distance travel or simply put stuff closer together. It's mind boggling this got shipped in this condition. Here's the worst part though. There's an auto-run input option for MKB but not controller. This means at least on some level they knew these long runs were a problem but responded in the laziest way possible.\n",

      "The game's level structure means you will rely on fast travel quite a lot. In a game about exploring this has paradoxically made it more difficult to just wander. In Skyrim or Fallout you could point yourself in a direction and just go. You can do that to some extent in Starfield and there's certainly more total area to explore but it's broken into smaller parts. If that 10 years of development went anywhere I'm expecting it went here. I bet they tried to make it all seamless but ultimately couldn't pull it off and fell back on fast travel. Whatever, no biggy. Still plenty to do and I used fast travel plenty in Skyrim and Fallout any how.\n",

By time you are high enough level to unlock the features and spending some points buffing your character, the game will have lost all novelty. Combat lacks challenge and increasing difficulty just makes enemies bullet sponges. The larger side quests are average, and not very compelling. I struggled to find a reason on why my character would help these groups, and most are them talk like smug pricks to your character for no reason. How space travel and fast travel are implemented is just awful. If i want to go to one star system, but my ship isn't good enough to get there in one jump, I instead have to make 3 separate jump each with a loading screen to get there. Overall the core game is just not very fun or engaging. If you read reviews and see people who claim they are having a blast 30 hours in and haven't even gotten to doing the second or third main mission. They must enjoy the repetitive procedural content and repeat mission boards. Which involve shooting the same boring enemies or doing the same task again and again. I don't think most people who are experienced with these types of games find that very fun. It's because as you complete a couple you will shortly realize they don't offer variety and their rewards can be obtained somewhere else easier and faster.  I give the game a 6/10 which is unfortunate because you can tell the detail and time that was put into the game especially for the designs of the ships and buildings both inside and out. I've played 61 hours and my last play session of an hour will probably be my last. The game just isn't there for me and while playing I just think that Bethesda's time would've been better spent on the next Elder Scrolls which more people would probably want. I was excited at the thought of a new Bethesda RPG, but sadly Starfield didn't do it for me. I would agree that a new IP would be good for Bethesda, but it honestly feels like Todd Howard wanted to make a space game while he could, so that's what we got instead of the next installment of their flagship series. This is not a game we should have waited 8 years for. It would have been better as a release 2-4 years after the next Elder Scrolls. So now we are stuck waiting for at least another 5 years just to potentially be disappointed after another long wait.\n",

      "So I do still really like the game, but i don't like it in the same way i like the more recent BGS games like skyrim or FO4. This games exploration is honestly not great.

You explore the more interesting locations this way, you get to experience the worldbuilding of this game which i think is mostly quite good, and you have good quest design that has a variety of things to do and several different ways to complete them. Thats the most enjoyable way to experience starfield.

      "Original: The game is alright, but it's got a lot of problems lol\n",
      "\n",
      "To start with positives, this game's aesthetic is fantastic and I really enjoyed the sci-fi realism aspect to it. Dubbed 'NASA punk' by Bethesda, the game's locations, vehicles, character/npc outfits as well as armor sets were super dope. (Big shout out to the armor sets, as that was my major problem with The Outer Worlds.) Game textures and lighting are a major improvement over Fallout 4 and Skyrim. Combat is extremely fun and satisfying, whether you are using melee or ranged weapons. In addition to this and without spoiling too much, the game has its own version of shouts from Skyrim. These abilities that are simply called 'Powers' in the game can be pretty useful, adding another interesting and varied layer to the combat as there are many different powers to collect. Having so many different powers naturally fosters player experimentation in how you can approach a fight. Additionally, this game has a good amount of enemy variety, with big props to the numerous hostile alien monsters that you can encounter on Starfield's many different planets.Speech, intimidation and bribery skills return from Bethesda's other titles, giving the player the freedom to circumvent different scenarios, get better rewards on top of getting better quest outcomes that you wouldn't get without them. Lockpicking/hacking skills also return, allowing you to rob AND pillage as much as your heart desires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Without spoiling anything, the main story and character performances are top notch and on par with Bethesda's other titles. While the main story starts off slow, it is ultimately fantastic and the new game plus mode in this title is actually integral to the game's story. The hand crafted side quests (not the procedurally generated ones) are varied and really fun to play through, ranging from basic missions to multi branching quest lines. Player choice is something Bethesda has always done well with all of their games since Morrowind and Starfield is no exception. There were some really tough choices I had to make while playing this game, especially the last choice. I find myself wondering if I made the right choices for the fate of the galaxy, the universe, and my player character. I also really liked that your options for choices are perfectly balanced, giving players the ability to be the savior of the galaxy, a ruthless unconscionable killer or something in between.\n",
      "\n",
      "So why does this game only have a 74% positive review rating on Steam and keeps getting hate from a lot of people? Well, I'll try to outline what other people’s problems with this game as well as address some of my own. First problem I want to mention is the game locks features behind certain perks, the jet pack and ship customization just to name a couple. I really thought Bethesda had learned their lesson when they removed the need to have a 'Power armor training' perk in Fallout 4, so why do I need a perk to customize my ship or just use my jetpack?

      "Next major negative about this game which almost everyone has touched upon is exploration. While it's far from a perfect game, I enjoyed The Outer World's much more focused approach to exploration. Especially compared to other games released in the last few months (*cough* *cough* Baldur's Gate 3) most of the game's map is unused and fosters absolutely no desire to explore outside of the game's main cities and settlements. In fairness, the handcrafted main cities and settlements are really cool and fun to explore, but they're concentrated to a small area of the world map that consists of maybe 10-11 star systems, making the other 89-90 star systems feel almost completely pointless. This problem only gets worse with the fact that the vendor economy is horrible and most vendors do not restock their items, making the player mostly rely upon enemy drops for ammo and grenades towards the end of the game. The procedurally generated content is, well, procedurally generated content that most people will have zero motivation to engage with beyond the first time because it is so repetitive. They could've made exploration a bit more enjoyable by adding land vehicles, however I don't really know how well that would've worked since the game only loads one area of each planet at a time and it is not a seamless experience like with Cyberpunk. \n",
      "\n",
      "On top of all of this other nonsense, space travel is completely half baked and is only fun/engaging in combat scenarios. In short, exploration is a mess and the procedurally generated planets are what everyone including myself predicted them to be: lifeless and boring. Bethesda's previous titles felt like there could be a reward or quest around every inch or corner. However many people have dubbed this game a \"loading screen simulator\" and unfortunately, I'm inclined to agree with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "To get into some other problems with the game, while the game's 'Powers' system is cool, how you get each ability is the same each time you get one. You find a temple on a planet, do the weird zero gravity puzzle, and you get the power. To be fair, Bethesda tries to mitigate the repetitiveness by adding a single enemy at the end of each of these temples called 'Guardians'. But other than these enemies that start to show up toward the latter portion of the game, these Temples are incredibly boring. I preferred Skyrim's roll out of its shouts much more, with the player able to find shouts pretty much everywhere throughout the game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of directions, the game has no local or planet maps which everybody including myself have complained about. I completely understand that the planets are procedurally generated and having local maps for each one would be a huge pain to program. But there is no absolutely no way you can justify not having local maps for the cities and settlements. I cannot tell you how many times I got lost going through the main cities of the game, and not at all in a fun kind of way. It honestly just boggles my mind seeing as how the cities are almost completely static and really don’t change at all throughout the game. The only good thing is that when you are in ‘scanner mode’ a trail of arrows will often lead you to your destination. BUT THE GAME WOULDN'T NEED THAT STUFF IF IT JUST ADDED LOCAL MAPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, I want to mention bugs and performance. While the game did not ship with many bugs, especially in comparison to Bethesda's other titles, it still has quite a few. None of these issues are game breaking, mostly just NPCs doing weird stuff, texture loading issues, and bugged achievements. The game was pretty stable and while I only had a handful of crashes, it's still worth mentioning here. Performance was fine in space and most planets, however almost every major settlement made the game's FPS drop significantly and stuttering was quite frequent. Especially since the main cities and settlements are where I recommend you spend most of your time, this is a major issue that needs to be fixed.\n",
      "\n",
      "TL;DR\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m admittedly a huge Bethesda fan, but there is nothing here that’s going to make a newcomer fall in love with the existing Bethesda formula. Bethesda really wanted this game to be their next Skyrim, and while Starfield is a pretty good game, I don’t think this will be the case even when the DLC drops. There are a lot of things that need to be fixed that just straight up probably won’t or can’t be fixed. Bethesda tried to be ambitious in a lot of ways with this title, and while that’s respectable, they also have moved backwards in a lot of ways with this title.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am ultimately gonna recommend this game to people who are already Fallout or Elder Scrolls fans, but I would tell pretty much everyone else to stay away at least until the DLC drops.  \n",

      "I have played Starfield all the way through, trying to complete every quest I found. Ended up Level 50 before the end. I have done everything this game has to offer me to give it a fair wag.

      "I love the universe. The factions while sometimes a little cookie cutter, have unique intricacies that give the world a tinge of depth. The feelings I had visiting places mentioned in game lore, or in our current history made me feel immersed and like a true explorer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The game world itself is another issue entirely. Starfield tries to make all planets fully explorable. Obviously this is not possible for a dev team running on a finite amount of time,  instead they attempted to use procedural generation to create world landscapes. Terrain is not bad, although it sometimes has hiccups. The main issue is the structures the game populates the landscape with. large structures are dev created and refined, so while nice they are very finite (Leading to you replaying game \"dungeons\"). This leads to them repeating a lot. Smaller structures are just assets the generation plops down willy-nilly and are so out of place they are almost always eyesores.\n",

      "Enemy variety is also not great. There are three hostile factions and then the occasional hostile alien. This gets worse when a quest chain makes you allied to one of the hostile factions reducing variety even further, for a significant portion of the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some very interesting mechanics, such as starships. Using them like a mobile base is a great idea, and the customisability truly makes it your own. There are several issues with the ship designer, such as inability to choose where doors and ladders appear, however in all, a very positive feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are bases. I was initially roped into bases by the idea of starting a colony on a foreign planet. Then it turns into a game of \"shit, I don't have X.\" where you are constantly making small offshoot bases to import resources to make your true base. This builds into an ever growing pile of tedium. All for a base with the impressiveness of a motorway bathroom. The amount of levels you need to sink into bases to start reaching high tier stuff is ridiculous, especially when you can just put it all into your ship which already functions as your base.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also regret saying it but the main faction/questline is not good either. Firstly the quests are very repetitive of \"Go to X. Find Y.\" which is horrible. Who saw the main avenue all players are designed to go down and made it the most boring copy and paste, side quest shit possible? Second the every character in the faction is either intensely annoying or inconsistent, which leads back to intensely annoying. To top this all off they are all law abiding and goody two shoes about everything. It would be quite easy to include a couple of less scrupulous characters in an organisation about spending time exploring the unknown. But no, everyone must be good, even the snake cult worshipper and the CEO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other quests and factions are pretty good. They tend to get a little fetch questy, but that's to be expected of a game that is about exploration. Additionally one of the more interesting quest lines I was playing bugged out meaning I could never complete it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other issues also plague this game such as terrible UI, which is a constant headache to deal with.\n",
      "\n",
      "While I have played many hours, many of them fully engaged and having fun. This game has somehow retroactively made the experience unpleasant. The lacklustre ending along with the knowledge of this is all the game is make me regret paying for and putting so much time into this game.\n",

The exploration is there, but it's presented in a different way than in other games. Instead of exploring a whole planet, you have to land anywhere on a planet.

      "Cons:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Heavy Reliance on Fast Travel: While the universe of Starfield is vast, the need to frequently fast travel between planets can detract from the sense of exploration and immersion.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Similar Planet Aesthetics: Many planets in Starfield look too similar, reducing the visual diversity of the game's universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Disconnected World: The game's universe can sometimes feel disjointed, with planets and settlements feeling isolated from one another. All planets are pretty empty even the main ones only have one big city and not much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Loading Screens: Starfield is plagued by frequent loading screens, which can disrupt the flow of gameplay and immersion.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Exploration Could Be More Fun: Many Planetes and the randomly generated buildings feel the same.\n",

      "In conclusion, Starfield is a promising step into the realm of space-faring RPGs by Bethesda. While it has its share of drawbacks, the game's strengths become increasingly evident the deeper you venture into its universe. The game is not a space simulation and you should not expect it to be a game like \"No Man‘s Sky\" but it is a classic Bethes RPG.\n",
      "With intriguing quests, a compelling main story, and the unmistakable Bethesda charm, Starfield is a journey worth embarking upon for fans of open-world RPGs and space enthusiasts alike.\n",

      "The history of bricks, its a fascinating journey that spans thousands of years and reflects the development of human civilization. Here is a brief overview of the history of bricks:\n",
      "\n",
      "Ancient Bricks (10,000 BCE - 3,000 BCE): The earliest evidence of bricks dates back to around 10,000 BCE when humans began making sun-dried mud bricks. These early bricks were made from clay or mud mixed with straw and were left to dry in the sun. They were commonly used in regions with abundant clay and became a foundational building material for early agricultural communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "First Fired Bricks (3,000 BCE - 2,000 BCE): The transition from sun-dried mud bricks to fired bricks marked a significant advancement. In Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq), around 3,000 BCE, people started firing bricks in kilns to harden them. These fired bricks were more durable and resistant to the elements than their sun-dried counterparts, making them suitable for construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brick Use in Ancient Civilizations: The use of bricks spread throughout ancient civilizations. In Egypt, the construction of the pyramids involved the use of fired bricks. In the Indus Valley Civilization (present-day India and Pakistan), bricks were used for building houses and cities. The Chinese also developed their own methods for making and using bricks around this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roman Bricks (1st century BCE - 5th century CE): The Romans made significant advancements in brick production and use. They introduced various shapes and sizes of bricks, and their use of concrete combined with bricks allowed for the construction of monumental structures such as the Colosseum and aqueducts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medieval and Renaissance Bricks (5th century CE - 16th century CE): During the Middle Ages in Europe, brickmaking techniques declined, and stone was the primary building material. However, brickmaking saw a revival during the Renaissance, particularly in Italy and the Netherlands. Intricate brickwork and patterns became common in architectural design.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial Revolution and Modern Bricks (18th century CE - Present): The Industrial Revolution in the 18th century brought significant innovations to brick production. Steam-powered brick-making machines were invented, making it easier and more efficient to produce bricks in large quantities. In the 19th and 20th centuries, bricks became a ubiquitous building material for homes, factories, and infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contemporary Bricks: In the 20th and 21st centuries, various types of bricks have been developed, including engineered and sustainable bricks. Engineers and architects have explored new forms and materials, such as concrete bricks and eco-friendly alternatives, to meet the demands of modern construction while considering environmental concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today, bricks continue to be a fundamental building material worldwide, valued for their durability, versatility, and aesthetic appeal. They are used in a wide range of architectural styles and construction projects, from traditional brick houses to cutting-edge contemporary designs. The history of bricks is a testament to human ingenuity in developing and refining construction techniques over millennia.\n",

      "Would only recommend playing through Game Pass unless you really like Bethesda's previous games and even then, it's not a guarantee that it'll be worth the asking price. I did enjoy Starfield enough to give a conditional recommendation, but it takes far too many steps back from earlier Bethesda games and doesn't compensate enough for those regressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "[h3]The Good[/h3]\n",
      "\n",
      "[b]Faction questlines[/b] are cool and the game is worth playing for those at least. The writing won't exactly blow you away if you're coming from more hardcore RPGs, but the questlines are fun for what they are. The main quest also has some solid quests but I didn't think that they reached the heights of the faction quests.\n",
      "\n",
      "The return of [b]RPG elements[/b] (for example, being able to choose traits that influence how you RP your character like in Fallout New Vegas) along with a silent protagonist is very welcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "[b]Combat[/b] feels very fluid, especially with the addition of the boost pack which gives you a huge amount of mobility. It's easily the best feeling combat in a Bethesda game, though it feels a bit easy overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "[b]Space combat[/b] can be pretty thrilling, even if it is a bit simple. It is easy to get a bad first impression since the first ship you get is not good for ship combat, so do invest in some ship upgrades whenever possible. That said, there are some situations where playing on harder difficulties can lead to near unwinnable fights. You can flee from a fight if this happens, but I don't think it changes the fact that even if you are prepared, ship combat can feel too punishing at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "[b]Ship building[/b] can suck you in for hours if you let it, though it's a bit restrictive when it comes to things like where doors and ladders get placed. \n",
      "\n",
      "[b]Graphics[/b] are decent most of the time. They put in a lot of effort making interiors feel lived-in and it shows. Planet surfaces are consistently stunning and screenshot-worthy which is admirable considering that they are procedurally generated. The designs of the creatures you find on planets are cool and range from cute to horrifying depending on what you find.\n",
      "\n",
      "[h3]The Bad[/h3]\n",
      "\n",
      "[b]Exploration[/b] is unfortunately pretty disappointing which is honestly not something I thought I would ever be saying about a modern Bethesda game. Exploration in Starfield mostly comes in the form of Points of Interest (PoIs) that are scattered around planets. While the location of the PoIs is randomly generated, the interiors of the PoIs are not. This can lead to situations where you can find the same \"Abandoned Cryo Lab\" on multiple different planets. Not only will they have the exact same layout, they will have the same enemy positions, the same item positions and even the same story-related things (notes, computer entries, dead bodies, etc). This probably isn't too bad if you're not constantly exploring planets as there is a ton of hand-crafted content outside exploration, but it feels awful once you come to realize how repetitive the PoIs are. Don't get me wrong though -- the dungeons in some PoIs are solid and have some interesting design layouts that make them fun to traverse on different builds, but the glaringly obvious repetition of the PoIs make exploration feel a lot less rewarding than other Bethesda games. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is an [b]optional gameplay loop in the main quest[/b] that is as bad as, if not worse than, Oblivion gates. Minor spoilers here, but it is [spoiler]literally about doing the same lame \"puzzle\" over and over again to acquire a power (an ability which function like shouts in Skyrim).[/spoiler] This is especially bizarre considering that [spoiler]Skyrim had you run unique dungeons to acquire shouts[/spoiler], which is way more engaging than whatever Starfield was going for here. I'm not even taking into account the unnecessarily tedious process that you might have to go through to repeat the loop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The [b]random encounters[/b] you have in space are entertaining at first but become repetitive because of the lack of variation in many encounters. For example, NPCs in some encounters always act as if it's their first time meeting you (even if you've met them a dozen times before). As a result, they quickly lose their charm as they tend to play out in the same way every time. \n",
      "\n",
      "[b]Enemy behaviors[/b] are lacking compared to Fallout 4. Starfield doesn't quite have anything like the feeling of hearing the [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QNlFvG0hkI]terrifying beep of a Super Mutant Suicider[/url] or the panic when a Sentry Bot suddenly sprints towards you to self-destruct in your face.\n",
      "\n",
      "The [b]user interface (UI)[/b] is tolerable on controller but terrible on mouse and keyboard. Because you have a rather low default carry weight (135 compared to 200 in Fallout 4, though you have an upgradable ship inventory which can hold ten times more), you will often find yourself doing inventory management and oh man does the inventory UI suck. You can't see both your inventory and a vendor's inventory at the same time when buying stuff. You can only see one stat at a time for the items you haven't selected (like a weapon's damage stat by default) and need to push a button to see other stats (like a weapon's value). You cannot sort by stack weight to see the combined weight of any identical items -- something you could already do in Fallout 76... All of these annoyances come together to create what is probably the worst Bethesda UI to date. Thankfully [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/773]StarUI[/url] exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The [b]weapon mod system[/b] is similar to Fallout 4's system but has been made more restrictive and grindy for some reason. You can't store weapon mods in your inventory anymore, so you can't just buy a gun that has a weapon mod you want and put that same mod on a gun of the same type. As a result, you are forced to either hope that you will eventually get the exact weapon mod setup you want (either through vendors or loot) or invest heavily into the Science skill tree. If you want to be able to craft most weapon mods, you need 8 skill points (plus an extra 5 points if you want *all* the weapon mods). Not to mention, you also need to invest resources into researching the weapon mods to craft them (this applies to most craftable items in the game). The amount of hoops you need to jump through just to craft items is excessive and way too grindy. At least in Fallout 4, you only needed 4 skill points to be able to craft all of the weapon mods on a hunting rifle (assuming you had the right SPECIAL) which felt much fairer. It doesn't help that the leveling can feel awfully slow at times either.\n",

      "[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\n",
      "\n",
      "Just to reiterate, I really did enjoy Starfield. There's still a ton of hand-crafted content that I haven't done and the good parts of the game are good enough that I'm still having fun this far in. \n",

      "\n",
      "I don't know if Starfield will have the longevity that other Bethesda games have because of how much Starfield regresses from them, but I think that it can become much more given enough time and support.

      "Inventory management itself is a pain, because you are constantly overweight and if you move something, the game doesn't tell you how much space the location you are moving to still has. \n",
      "You also only have a very small, limited carrying capacity.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is once again a ton of items to loot, some with seemingly really good value, however vendors actually give you at best 15% of its \"value\" for it and you can't take random items apart so they are actually entirely useless. Doesn't help that 99% of \"loot\" are just notebads and folders or food. \n",
      "This also kinda means that you can't really be a trader either, because everything is expensive to buy but worthless to sell. Weapons and gear that say they are worth thousands often give you 400 at best from vendors but are also very heavy to carry.\n",

After another cutscene you either press a button to get up from your seat or teleport to the outside. Flying is only possible in specific locations, like in orbit.\n",

I usually like a hard science scifi worlds, although I prefer the ones more \"out there\" such as Warhammer 40k and Mechwarrior. But this is a painful mash of Star Trek and Star Wars, with a huge dose of NASA-aesthetics.

Now spacesuits are, to be kind, not cool-looking. At least not the ones in Starfield. In fact, when you join the \"main quest faction\", you are given a full suit/helmet/oxygen pack set that looks for all the world like a NASA astronaut from our day. If you buy the special edition of the game, you get a skin that makes the white look like aluminium foil. Shiny, I guess.\n",

It's like Solitude all over again. One street with all the stores and you're supposed to feel like you're in a giant metropolis. It's even in a perfect straight line! Considering how many star systems have empty or nearly empty planets, why could there not be more focus to make the large cities actually large? The third city, meant to be a bit smaller, was about the size of Whiterun. Once you know the layout, it feels pretty small.\n",

      "The game feels more like a 2010 release than 2023. For example, I rescued some hostages and, as they ran out to safety, the wife of one of them is waiting anxiously on the street. The two NPCs stop two meters from each other and she says something like \"oh I'm so happy you're alright!\"... while looking at me, because I stepped a little bit too close. There is no hugging animation, no holding hands animation, nothing. They just stood there and recited their lines like some horrid amateur theater.\n",

      "This kind of problematic is found throughout the game. You think you did something fun/neat/cool, and then the game lets you down hard with a complete lack of attention to any form of detail that would add realism and thus the whole thing becomes very jarring.

Items flying and bouncing around for no reason (I became nostalgic about my house in Whiterun, where a Raw Rabbit Leg tried to hit me in the forehead every time I entered). When buying a new ship, the captain locker's inventory does not tag along or even teleport to your own inventory. Escort quests (yes, they still exist!) are just as buggy as they have always been. In the inventory screen, the area that normally shows the item or your character can become pure black, or your clothing change doesn't register.

      "I was gifted this game by a Subscriber to my channel, but my review is based on the fact that someone did pay for me to have this game. That being said, I did put in a ton of effort and time to play through to NG+ (Not NG+10), collect all 24 powers, collect all achievements and try to genuinely have a good time with this game. Sadly, I became more and more frustrated the further I got into the game. There were also several instances during the game I was forced (by game play mechanics) to either do or be put into situations that were very uncomfortable (even being in a solo game). Despite the game clearly adding aspects that were politically and socially motivated, I tried to put my judgments aside (as best as I could). \n",
      "Below I do cover some of the Pros and Cons I found with the game. However, I am going to have to give the game a dislike overall. If the devs did take 9-25 years to make this game (depending on the article you read from), then they got lazy. I really had hopes for so much more with the hype surrounding this game.\n",

      "* Voiced NPC Dialog\n",
      "* Ability to Build your own starship(s)\n",
      "* Base Building\n",
      "* Ability to Craft (kinda)\n",
      "* Planetary Exploration (Kinda)\n",

      "\n",
      "CONS:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Not Multiplayer: Trying to play this game and be in Discord with a friend is almost pointless. Neither of you can hear or listen to the other because you have to hear all the voiced dialog.\n",
      "\n",
      "* First and Third Person Views: There are many times in the game where you have to switch between first and third person views to do, see or interact with certain things or items in the game. I missed or had to search the web on what I was missing in a quest because of the issue of not thinking to switch on the fly. I personally play third person in many games and this game is very frustrating to play in third person way too often.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In-depth Stories and Voiced Dialog: As awesome as many of the stories are, this game is extremely dialog heavy. I feel that the devs deliberately tried to make each dialog interaction as long as humanly possible. Thank goodness I did not have to read all that dialog. Even the dialog you hear as you walk by NPC's chatting with each other are super long. No one talks that way, it is ridiculously long. Also, much of the dialog seems like it is slowed down to make it take even longer for them to say what is needed to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Special Relationships with Companions: The ability to establish a relationship with Companions is fun. However, there are only a select few to choose from. The dialog from these companions can be very creepy at best. the male companions always sound like they are talking to me (In game character is He/Him Male with Masculine walk) in their bedroom voice. This was very creepy to hear all the time. It is clear that the dialog for the male characters were deliberately voiced like this. One of the female voices were also very bedroom-ish. Leaving only one clear choice for me to choose as my in-game Special Relationship. If this is going to be a thing in games, then the player choices during character creation should be part of the dialog selection. I would recommend just keeping the robot as your follower. At least it doesn't constantly hit on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "* In-depth Storylines: Be ready to listen to a ton, I mean a Ton of deliberately lengthened dialog. It is very evident that the devs are trying to boost their playtime stats, by adding a ton of dialog. Most people do not talk and say so many words about any simple subject. If you are into lore and background stories, then you will probably like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Awesome Graphics and Visuals: Now, the game is absolutely beautiful and has a lot of very stunning views. This being said, there is not a lot of originality. You can see a lot of the same views on many of the same planets. \n",
      "\n",
      "* Exploration: Exploring planets is very lack luster. There is a ton of copy/paste groups of buildings around each of the planets. When I first started the game, it was exciting to go visit random buildings and get in fire fights. I realized very quickly that most of the buildings were the same, with very little variation. Not to mention, visiting random buildings aside from the quest buildings, does not offer any real reward or benefit other than thinking you are doing something different.\n",
      "\n",
      "* Crafting: Crafting in this game should not be called crafting at all. Yes, you can craft all types of items. Tons of them. However, you CAN NOT craft weapons, suits, helmets, or clothing. You can craft \"Modifications\" to weapons and suits that you purchase or find while looting. You might think this is cool, but it really isn't. Just go looting and you'll most likely find better upgrades much faster than collecting materials to make the items required to craft the Mods. \n",

      "- Performance is bad.\n",
      "- KBM controls are terrible.\n",
      "- Console controls are only marginaly better.\n",
      "- Rebinding console controls just breaks everything because some controls can't be changed.\n",
      "- UI is console-centric and is terrible to navigate with KBM.\n",
      "- Menu items which can't be clicked instead you need to push a key and hold.\n",
      "- Alternation of pressing and holding the same buttons.\n",
      "- Navigating with arrows barely works, if mouse hovers any single button it steals the focus.\n",
      "- Inventory screens are a disgrace, you never know if you're buying, selling, or transfering items, and it's all a chore.\n",
      "- Menu shortcuts don't work when menu is already open, you can't press 'I' to opens inventory and press 'L' open the log, you must close all menus before.\n",
      "- When rebinding keys, you can't cancel a binding capture, if you press ESC it binds ESC, and unbinds ESC for opening the game's main menu, then you can no longer open the menu to change that binding again, hahaha.\n",
      "- Scanner disables all controls and shortcuts except \"close scanner\".\n",
      "- Elevators, trains, and other disguised loading screens are atrociously designed.\n",
      "- Weight management is a mess, weight of items seems rather random, tiny light items are heavier than bulky and heavy items, some things like ammo and medkits weigh nothing and you can hoard millions.\n",
      "- Useful items like health packs, ship parts, or lockpicks, are drowned among trash.\n",
      "- Ship cargo is ridiculously small and similarily encumbered by small yet heavy trash, yet you can cram a hundred times more gear inside your ship hab modules than in your cargo.\n",
      "- Entire economy is backwards, most ship parts cost less than a rifle, good weapons cost as much as a ship, it makes no sense.\n",
      "- Can't sort items by total weight or quantity, nor get a breakdown of weight by category.\n",
      "- Sorting orders isn't remembered anyway.\n",
      "- Stolen consumables like ammo or lockpicks are likely to forever remain in your inventory, they aren't priorized for use, even when used manually the non-stolen ones are used instead.\n",
      "- You can sell stolen items to most sellers, and buy them back at the same price, and stolen flag is removed. What's the point?\n",
      "- The above also counts towards levelling your commerce skill.\n",
      "- Levelling weapon skills is as easy as shooting harmless aliens on some moons.\n",
      "- Killing aliens counts as \"surveying\" them, a genocide is must faster than using the scanner.\n",

      "- You can mine water, it looks like a rock, but you can't mine the vast bodies of water on the planet.\n",

      "- Mission menu almost hidden on main menu, what were they thinking.\n",
      "- On map menu, no list of all systems, planets or POIs, and surely no search feature, need to mouse over each off them to find a place.\n",
      "- Procedurally generated content is highly repetitive, it barely lasted 4 hours until I knew every loot hidden in every outpost.\n",
      "- Cities are nothing but a series of big buildings where you can only enter the akwardly huge and empty lobby with a single NPC inside, this somehow requires a loading screen.\n",

      "- Flashlight is terrible, angle is too narrow.\n",
      "- There are beer taps in zero G stations.\n",
      "- Ship habs link in weird ways, most of the time two habs side by side won't be accessible, you'll have to circle the entire ship.\n",
      "- You can walk with a gun out and you're fine, shoot in the air even.\n",
      "- Can't preview what ship habs contain, you have to buy them and then be disappointed at what's inside.\n",
      "- Ship boarding shows how unpractical habitat modules.\n",
      "- Plenty places where you get stuck.\n",
      "- Can get stuck behind an open airlock.\n",
      "- Enemies can run through an opening airlock, even when it's still almost closed.\n",
      "- When wildlife is angry at you but you're out of reach, they throw rocks.\n",
      "- Surveying planets leads to \"no results\", you can't check the list of species you scanned, if only to see which one you're missing, data can only be viewed when facing the species, not in any menu. Gives a weird idea of \"exploring\" and \"surveying\" when your reports are nowhere to be found.\n",
      "- When overencumbered, flying with jetpack uses oxygen for some reason, unless you're flying while walking, then it's okay, jetpack works full power regardless.\n",
      "- Binary star visibility on map is trash, took me hours to figure it out, especially due to bad KBM menu interaction which makes it feel like \"clicks don't register\" rather than \"it's a binary star\".\n",
      "- Star map is \"3D\" for some aesthetic reason probably, a flat map with connections between systems would have been better and clearer.\n",
      "- If you quick travel to a place on a planet you've been before, you spawn directly outside your ship, hope you have a spacesuit on!\n",

In Starfield, you basically start as a miner, and are given a big task by your boss - to dig up a very special piece of metal from a rock. For some reason you must walk the last few dozen meters of the cave alone. You do that and are given an unskippable vision that you will later start to despise when it's shown to you a 100th time. Now, the guy that ordered it all done decides touching the metal piece has made you special and suddenly trustworthy enough to give you his spaceship (even though he owns no other means of transportation), his robot and his watch, followed by a task to deliver the metal part he payed for, to a place you have never been to before.

There is no saving the universe, there is no defeating a super villain, there is no real gain for the protagonist [spoiler] (apart from a few more or less useless powers) [/spoiler], you are not (really) 'the chosen one'.

It was something new, not very challenging and yet satisfying, required some brains. But the problem is (compared to Fallout) that you can't really get skillful enough in it (both in game or IRL as a player), to make it seamless. In Fallout you could get good enough at the lockpick minigame, that it would take you seconds to complete. Similarly the hacking minigame, with high enough in-game skill, you could just quickly guess the correct password, as there were not many options to choose from. In Starfield you won't have that. For every minigame you will need to spend time. And considering the amount of the containers that require lockpicking in this game, after 100+ hours you will grow to absolutely despise this minigame.\n",

To even be able to do any of these things in Starfield, you need to endure hours of pain, grinding the required perks. And even then, at the cost of all the perks that you spent on leveling crafting, you could have just pick up way cheaper and less grindy damage boost perks, and use randomly generated weapons found in the world.

Along the way, there are core missions and randomly recurring scripted acitivities.  Some more engaging than others.  Some much more involved than others.  For the random reoccurring activities, the time invested to dopamine gained ratio isn't great for most of them, especially when they become redundant, but it's a step in the right direction.\n",

      "And that is very much like Outer Worlds, in the sense that each inhabited place you go there will be something you'll be asked to do plus you have main story arcs to follow.  Possibly a little more flexible.  But also less crafted and more redundant as you have played longer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The No Man's Sky additions are noteworthy.  Establishing an outpost, setting up automated mining of resources, storing the resources, and doing rudimentary crafting.  Skyrim never had this - you couldn't even take over a finite mine of resources never mind tap an infinite one.  But one of the faults with No Man's Sky and now Starfield is that infinite resources devalues all resources.  As it should in a truly galactic empire.  And the way you bring value back to a system of infinite resources is by being able to craft and tailor goods and items.  Except No Man's Sky and Starfield don't let you do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "At least in Skyrim I could craft armor and weapons.  Not in Starfield.  And you're extremely dependent on random loot /store goods for baseline stats in Starfield.  Even with a completed skill tree and completed research to craft everything available for weapons and armor, there are numerous characteristics that dropped equipment can have which you cannot add as a mod (even with less impressive stats).\n",

      "Anyway, like armor and weapons which have slots and very limited mod options, ships have parts with very bland variations, and mods or customization possibilities.  At least with a weapon, I can loot an enemy for an Advanced Orion rifle, add mods to give it increased range, better visibility scope, and increase the magazine size to suit my typical game play needs.  On a ship, you upgrade the engine and... yep, that's it.  No slots to add a mod to make it run more efficiently or give up some overall speed for better manueverability or something.  Just mix and match parts as best your able after a very slow skill tree climb to be able to even use the equipment.\n",

      "Split: you only get diablo style rng loot. in skyrim, you could select pants, helmet, chest piece. in fallout 4 bethesda took a step forward and gave us a modular armor system, where your legs, arms, chest, head, and undershirt can all be mixed and matched to give you the armor and look you want. this is before power armor, which adds a second layer to all of those. starfield has 4 options. clothes, suit, helmet, pack. i would have thought that the space suit system would atleast be modular like power armor from instead of “ oh man i ' m hoping to finish off my full set of armor that i can customize, mix and match pieces, and then what ’ s this?!? i see a guard / bandit over there wearing the piece i need! i ’ m going to go kill him and take it! ” it ’ s “ wow, that bandit is wearing cool armor, i wish i could take that. this is pretty lame in un - immersive well atleast i got the sparkly destiny loot crate that gives me an item with a purple name that decreases oxygen consumption by 1 % ” they didn ’ t make a new engine,\n",

      "Original: I've been a Bethesda fan since TES III and I'll summarize. I can't recommend this game in the current state it's in.\n",
      "Things that I think need to be improved:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Exploration.\n",
      "Currently you land on a point on a planet or moon and it randomly generates points of interest to visit.\n",
      "This means that every time you land you will always get more or less points of interest to visit regardless of the area.\n",
      "It seems very artificial.\n",
      "Also when you have visited several planets, the points of interest are always the same, a copy and paste exactly the same, the zones do not vary.\n",
      "The same reward chests in the same place, the same locked doors, the same npcs to loot, the same diaries, etc, everything is exactly the same.\n",
      "How could this be solved? By making the points of interest, labs, factories, etc, be procedurally generated just like the planets.\n",
      "They have a lot of resources and tools in the outpost editor.\n",
      "\n",
      "-The planet scrolling.\n",
      "Currently it works by clicking on an area of the planet and it loads a random area with boundaries.\n",
      "It would be nice if you could travel with the ship inside the planet and it would generate terrain procedurally to give the feeling that you can travel around the planet with its points of interest to visit.\n",
      "There could be problems with the landing with this method of displacement in real time, as for example that there are rocks on the surface,\n",
      "simple, like in the outpost, the rocks are eliminated to leave space to the ship to land. In this case it would be the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Resource extraction.\n",
      "It would be nice that the mass extraction of resources would serve for something, because currently as far as I have seen it serves to get a few credits and that's it.\n",
      "These credits are easily obtained by exploring points of interest or selling objects, the work of creating commercial or industrial mineral extraction posts is not satisfactorily rewarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Crafting and item traits.\n",
      "Currently weapons and armor in Starfield are found randomly and come with random traits, some more useful and others less.\n",
      "That makes you store low level weapons and armor because they have unusual, epic or legendary traits but end up not being useful because of the low level of the weapon.\n",
      "Something interesting would be to be able to research the traits of weapons, helmets, spacesuits, outfits and backpacks to learn their effects and apply them in the weapons you want at a cost, of unusual, rare, exotic, and unique items according to the rarity of the trait of the object.\n",
      "The rarer the trait of the item, the more difficult it will be to obtain the materials. In addition to being able to create weapons and armor on your workbench.\n",
      "\n",
      "-Degradation of weapons, helmets, space suits, backpacks and attire.\n",
      "Currently the mentioned items are unbreakable and as a general rule, you will always play with the equipment that has the best stats.\n",
      "This is boring. It would be good to establish a system to degrade them like Fallout 76 or TES III. \n",
      "This would allow the use of different weapons and equipment, and would also give sense to the automated extraction of resources from the posts.\n",
      "You would need to get resources periodically to repair equipment.\n",
      "\n",
      "-interface or ui\n",
      "Currently when you click on follow project or post object a magnifying glass appears marking the materials that are needed and nothing else.\n",
      "When you click on follow several projects you can't see anywhere in the interface which projects you are following.\n",
      "When you accumulate several projects and objects to track, it is impossible to remember which projects or objects you are following.\n",
      "This could be improved with a window that shows the projects or craftable objects that you are currently tracking.\n",

      "\n",
      "If this game is Bethesda's passion project, then they've lost their passion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plenty of reviewers are dragging Starfield for its technical issues. While it's true that Bethesda should not get a free pass on that stuff just because \"lol, they're Bethesda\", I was prepared to accept a certain level of jank if it meant experiencing an inspired world. What really kills this game is that the setting itself is deeply, relentlessly boring. It's a haphazard collage of space frontier tropes. And you know what? That could have been fine. Tropes can be effective when wielded in service of a strong creative vision. But here, there is no greater vision. There is nothing, and I mean *nothing*, to this setting beyond the tropes that serve as its foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our major powers, we have a vaguely Western-flavored federal government, a vaguely Texan-flavored frontier alliance, a vaguely Eastern-flavored corpocracy, some scrappy pirates, and some mysterious religious zealots. There is nothing meaningful to know about any of these societies beyond whatever pictures of them you just conjured in your head. If you have an ounce of creativity, the pictures in your head are probably more detailed and compelling than the crap that made it into the game. It almost seems like these factions have been consciously sanitized, as if someone went through the first draft and removed any cultural or aesthetic identifiers beyond the baseline of \"Hey, this frontier guy wears a cowboy hat, likes guns, and has a bit of a stubborn streak!\". You'd think that the writers would be forced to come up with some creative quirks just to explain how these people adapted to their alien environments, but even that minimal level of flavor exceeds the bounds of Bethesda's vision.\n",
      "\n",
      "This aggressive blandness persists at every scale. We have planets that run the gamut of environmental conditions, but none of them impose meaningful gameplay changes (aside from gravity's effect on jump height, which is basically the lowest hanging fruit possible), inspire variations on the ten or so prefabricated structures that we can encounter, or even have much influence on which of the handful of flora, fauna, and feature assets can populate the game's tragically samey landscapes. One of the foundational aspects of space exploration as a genre is exploring how extreme conditions shape strategies and societies. Starfield cares so little for this relationship that it borders on immersion-breaking. I expected that Starfield would rely on repeatable assets to some extent, and that exploration would lose its shine once you've exhausted the list of things to encounter. What I didn't expect was just how short that list would be, or how sloppily curated it would be in the context of the game's environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there's the writing. Oh goodness, the writing. The best thing I can say is that, on a micro scale, it consists of grammatically correct sentences which could plausibly be uttered by a sane human being. Beyond that, it's shot through with the same listlessness that permeates every other aspect of the game. I'll present two case studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came upon a sidequest where an unknown vessel was orbiting a resort planet. Investigation reveals it to be a generation ship sent from Old Earth, back before humanity developed FTL travel. They don't take it well when you explain that their new home has already been claimed by Space Epcot. The captain asks you, some random hobo who just happened across them, to negotiate with the corpos on their behalf. They send along no observers or advocates, and don't even think to request a direct line of communication. The corpos offer you three options: blow up the ship and kill the colonists, coerce them into indentured servitude, or pay out of your own pocket to install an FTL drive aboard their ship so they can find another planet. There are no other options to advocate for the colonists. At no point does either party express any sort of cultural interest, or even basic curiosity about the other. There are no potential interactions with other factions or alternate arrangements for compensation, despite it being well-established that everything to do with Old Earth (down to the meanest paperweight) is treated as an invaluable piece of vintage history. The situation has the setup for a potentially game-changing historical event, and the most interesting thing Bethesda can squeeze from it is \"Corpos bad, are you willing to pay to feel better than them?\" If a 15th century carrack made landfall on the shores of Florida carrying the long lost descendents of Ferdinand Magellan's twin brother, I don't think Disney World's first reaction would be \"♥♥♥♥, they want our land, pump 'em full of lead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Second case study. There's a plotline where you infiltrate the big pirate faction on behalf of the feds, right under the nose of their cunning leader and his paranoid, security-obsessed XO. So how do you stay in contact with your handlers during this delicate deep cover op? By PHYSICALLY FLYING FROM THE PIRATE BASE TO THE FEDERAL FLAGSHIP every time you complete a mission. Holy hell, are dead drops not a thing in this universe? Are the feds actively trying to give you away? During these OpSec-destroying excursions, you'll have the opportunity to turn in supplementary evidence on the pirates' many crimes. This evidence comes in the form of incriminating tapes that are just laying around in the general vicinity of the perpetrators. None of them, including the canny, wary pirate leaders, will raise objections to you stuffing said tapes into your knapsack in full view of everyone. While turning in these tapes, you'll speak to the federal XO, who repeatedly inquires as to your impressions of the pirate leader. You can either lie and say he's a nosepicking vagrant, in which case you'll be praised for your patriotism, or you can accurately inform her that he's an intelligent and charismatic figure who poses a real threat, in which case she'll chew you out for the betrayal of respecting the enemy. The questline sustains this level of cartoonishness right up to the end, where the defeated, betrayed pirate leader tells your narc ass that he's proud of you because deep down, you're the greatest pirate of all.

      "Plenty of reviewers are dragging Starfield for its technical issues. While it's true that Bethesda should not get a free pass on that stuff just because \"lol, they're Bethesda\", I was prepared to accept a certain level of jank if it meant experiencing an inspired world. What really kills this game is that the setting itself is deeply, relentlessly boring. It's a haphazard collage of space frontier tropes. And you know what? That could have been fine. Tropes can be effective when wielded in service of a strong creative vision. But here, there is no greater vision. There is nothing, and I mean *nothing*, to this setting beyond the tropes that serve as its foundation. \n",
      "\n",
      "For our major powers, we have a vaguely Western-flavored federal government, a vaguely Texan-flavored frontier alliance, a vaguely Eastern-flavored corpocracy, some scrappy pirates, and some mysterious religious zealots. There is nothing meaningful to know about any of these societies beyond whatever pictures of them you just conjured in your head. If you have an ounce of creativity, the pictures in your head are probably more detailed and compelling than the crap that made it into the game. It almost seems like these factions have been consciously sanitized, as if someone went through the first draft and removed any cultural or aesthetic identifiers beyond the baseline of \"Hey, this frontier guy wears a cowboy hat, likes guns, and has a bit of a stubborn streak!\". You'd think that the writers would be forced to come up with some creative quirks just to explain how these people adapted to their alien environments, but even that minimal level of flavor exceeds the bounds of Bethesda's vision. \n",
      "\n",
      "This aggressive blandness persists at every scale. We have planets that run the gamut of environmental conditions, but none of them impose meaningful gameplay changes (aside from gravity's effect on jump height, which is basically the lowest hanging fruit possible), inspire variations on the ten or so prefabricated structures that we can encounter, or even have much influence on which of the handful of flora, fauna, and feature assets can populate the game's tragically samey landscapes. One of the foundational aspects of space exploration as a genre is exploring how extreme conditions shape strategies and societies. Starfield cares so little for this relationship that it borders on immersion-breaking. I expected that Starfield would rely on repeatable assets to some extent, and that exploration would lose its shine once you've exhausted the list of things to encounter. What I didn't expect was just how short that list would be, or how sloppily curated it would be in the context of the game's environments. \n",
      "\n",
      "And then there's the writing. Oh goodness, the writing. The best thing I can say is that, on a micro scale, it consists of grammatically correct sentences which could plausibly be uttered by a sane human being. Beyond that, it's shot through with the same listlessness that permeates every other aspect of the game. I'll present two case studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "I came upon a sidequest where an unknown vessel was orbiting a resort planet. Investigation reveals it to be a generation ship sent from Old Earth, back before humanity developed FTL travel. They don't take it well when you explain that their new home has already been claimed by Space Epcot. The captain asks you, some random hobo who just happened across them, to negotiate with the corpos on their behalf. They send along no observers or advocates, and don't even think to request a direct line of communication. The corpos offer you three options: blow up the ship and kill the colonists, coerce them into indentured servitude, or pay out of your own pocket to install an FTL drive aboard their ship so they can find another planet. There are no other options to advocate for the colonists. At no point does either party express any sort of cultural interest, or even basic curiosity about the other. There are no potential interactions with other factions or alternate arrangements for compensation, despite it being well-established that everything to do with Old Earth (down to the meanest paperweight) is treated as an invaluable piece of vintage history. The situation has the setup for a potentially game-changing historical event, and the most interesting thing Bethesda can squeeze from it is \"Corpos bad, are you willing to pay to feel better than them?\" If a 15th century carrack made landfall on the shores of Florida carrying the long lost descendents of Ferdinand Magellan's twin brother, I don't think Disney World's first reaction would be \"Shit, they want our land, pump 'em full of lead!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Second case study. There's a plotline where you infiltrate the big pirate faction on behalf of the feds, right under the nose of their cunning leader and his paranoid, security-obsessed XO. So how do you stay in contact with your handlers during this delicate deep cover op? By PHYSICALLY FLYING FROM THE PIRATE BASE TO THE FEDERAL FLAGSHIP every time you complete a mission. Holy hell, are dead drops not a thing in this universe? Are the feds actively trying to give you away? During these OpSec-destroying excursions, you'll have the opportunity to turn in supplementary evidence on the pirates' many crimes. This evidence comes in the form of incriminating tapes that are just laying around in the general vicinity of the perpetrators. None of them, including the canny, wary pirate leaders, will raise objections to you stuffing said tapes into your knapsack in full view of everyone. While turning in these tapes, you'll speak to the federal XO, who repeatedly inquires as to your impressions of the pirate leader. You can either lie and say he's a nosepicking vagrant, in which case you'll be praised for your patriotism, or you can accurately inform her that he's an intelligent and charismatic figure who poses a real threat, in which case she'll chew you out for the betrayal of respecting the enemy. The questline sustains this level of cartoonishness right up to the end, where the defeated, betrayed pirate leader tells your narc ass that he's proud of you because deep down, you're the greatest pirate of all.

For example, the \"shield\" interface shows some squiggly lines wobbling around, instead of your ship having an exterior representation of it's shield. Traveling in space is largely pointless, unless you're doing it just for roleplay purposes, as you can fast-travel just about anywhere within range, without having explored it first.\n",

      "- [b]Cut-and-paste random machinery:[/b] You'll see a bunch of identical machinery with no variation across multiple planets -- sometimes even on the same planet. Instead of a cool structure on the horizon indicating some side-quest or mystery to solve, it often just means you're going to find the same 2 loot containers with the same 3 junk items as the last time you saw that same building. It's a shame there isn't more variety, or at least some procedural configurations for these buildings.\n",
      "- [b]Illogical loot:[/b] This point is twofold. First is that gravity doesn't seem to affect carry weight. For all the fuss made about gravity being a mechanic, where your boosts and explosives can cause dramatic effects, your carry weight is firmly locked as a universal constant, regardless of your local gravity. Second point is that the loot doesn't make sense. You can find perfectly preserved food in rotting places, or find irrelevant loot in places that doesn't make sense. It doesn't matter what the underlying system is that caused this -- the point is, it made it into the final experience, and it breaks immersion for the player.\n",

For example, outside of The Lodge, there's just massive areas of poorly-textured parks. No other NPCs, vendors, etc. Just The Lodge, in what feels like a nature preserve. If that's the intended case, why not go over-the-top with the detail and richness of that area? It feels forgotten, and at the mercy of a difficult-to-use engine.\n",
