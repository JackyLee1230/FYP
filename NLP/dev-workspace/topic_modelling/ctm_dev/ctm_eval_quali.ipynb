Don't get put off by the dated visuals, the depth is infinite and Warband is one of the best ten games I have ever played in my entire life so far.

Both sides seem to be pretty balanced, however humans seem to rely on teamwork a lot more (so crappy team mates make for a less than stellar game). The visuals are pretty impressive when turned on max settings. The dark areas, along with clutter makes the human play a little bit on edge at times. More frequent updates would be nice, the new 'dropable' skins are a nice touch. I also find that the community along with many other games can be pretty crappy at times, with a lot of trash talking. Matchmaking also is pretty rough sometimes especially when just starting, being a level 10 going against 2 level 100 sharks is pretty tough if you dont have a good team.\",\n",

So once i was 'set up', i've spent over 50 hours in the game and there are things that i felt were missing, and at the later end of the 50 hours i started feeling like i had burnt through all the content. Like i didn't find any new technologies, chats with alien races started getting So you might ask why i'm giving this a positive review? Mostly because damnitall i've had SO much fun in this game, exploring, and just beholding. It's beautiful. I also have high hopes for fixes and added content, if things go well, this will eventually be well worth the 59,99! Though i had hopes for Starforge aswell, so we'll see. Staying positive though.

       "  (\"I will start by stating that I got this game for free for the sole purpose of testing and reviewing it. This game is not the normal type of game I review, and with that being said I recruited my girlfriend's help in this one. TL;DR is in the last section of review. The Game: The game itself was built in GameMaker, with a supposed 500 hours invested into the design. The music and all the art is original which is a solid change from some of the RPG Maker games I've seen. The fast-paced survival in Three Days works really well, against what I had originally anticipated actually. There is a real urgency in collecting resources but I did feel a bit thrown into the mix. The crafting in this game is also taken from a unique perspective. Think of the world as your inventory, you just simply drag and drop items on top of each other to create things. While a lot of the game is unfinished, I see a lot of potential in this, and believe it'll continue to be developed. The Developer: My hopes are very high when I see a developer actually talking with his players. Lueshie and I worked together for a bit to pin down some bugs, and I for one want to see more of that. He took all of what I said constructively and was very calm and polite throughout. Which I feel is quite absent in most developers. He's the kind of person you can see actually cares. As I spammed him with bugs and stuff I felt was obvious that was overlooked, he patiently updated his bug tracker and I watched as things I found were added to the list. The Girlfriend: One of the best things about this game so far is the crafting page. I looked at it after I made a spear by accident. I hate how fast the game goes, but it is understandable at this point in the games development. Killing the chickens was also very enjoyable after I learned how to kill them. Figuring out how to eat was a pain as well; I thought you could just drag and drop the food onto the character rather than click multiple times. Trying to use the spear to fish was a bit of a hassle. It would be awesome in the future to be able to customize the character as well. Conclusion (TL;DR) The game at it's core has an honest new take on an old idea. It's fun and refreshing to see this put into effect. This game was released today, so bugs on a new game are expected however and to be perfectly honest, some of the bugs are kinda fun to mess with. Overall a good experience, and funny to watch my girlfriend triumph over chickens.\",\n",

       "  (\"Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'? No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting. If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox. Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook). What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.\",\n",

It is the fact that there are so many creative ways in which you can complete puzzles and get about and around in the game that made me stick around. You play as 3 people whose souls are stuck in the Trine. If you play alone, then you have to switch out between the Wizard, the Thief, and the Warrior. Each character has different special abilities, giving you the opporunity to solve the same puzzles in so many different ways. As a gamer, it really makes you feel creative when you solve a difficult puzzle/climb a difficult part of a level in your own unique way.

As many have said, it connects dark souls-combat (albeit heavier) to a diabloish universe. The monster and item design was cool, and the numerous hidden secrets make for an interesting experience. Many of the boss fights were lovely, although the damage I inflicted upon them felt neglible and the overall length of the fight was very long, boss kills ranging from 3-10 minutes. However, seeing that the game itself focuses even more on windows of opportunity and the rare occasions of being able to load a combo (which many weapons have, interesting mix-ups of light and heavy attacks) on an enemy. The level design is also solid, feeling threatening, seeing closed portculli and doors right and left, only for you to find that it was a shortcut to the section or activated by a pressure plate. The entire scenario is very much a mix-up of the Painted World of Ariamis and the third act of Diablo 3. I will be honest in my opinion that there was room for improvement at times, regarding the story, characters, overall itemization and ranged combat. Most of the times when I hit a brick wall in terms of multiple monsters or a strong individual one, I resorted to spam projectiles with my gauntlet (which uses mana as a resource and allows you to deal dmg from afar, and through a shield in most cases) killing them as easily as a ranged fighter in Souls games in general. The game left me asking for more, even though the ending itself was quite weird and basically left a chance for a season pass to come, and there still are several things I want to see regarding hidden gems like alternate boss kill challenges and what happens if I choose otherwise at sidequests. The game was very stable on me, and I only experienced minor lag during a session of multiple hours, although the loading screens and transitions were quite long. I will be on lookout for the announced puzzle-oriented Library DLC, and wish the best for those who have poor experiences with the game regarding performance issues.

Stephen Merchant and Simmons lend their considerable voice talent, and along with some brilliant set pieces set to an equally brilliant score, the game is full of life where the first game felt thin and minimalist. The increased production values are the most immediate and tangible improvement, but the new toys on hand also bring with them fresh challenges that really stretch the possibilities of 3D puzzle solving, but never to the point where things become too demanding (this of course will vary with your own observational and spatial awareness). The '2' in Portal 2 also hints at a fully developed co-op mode, among some of the best.

Good on 4A to fix things. I hope other people who had the same issue as me have the games working now. Playing the first part of 2033 Redux reminds me of the original Metro LL in terms of graphics, and the game seems smoother than the original. I still had to hack the config files to fix the crappy FOV. Just like the originals. So I'll only recommend both games for people who haven't played the Metro Series before. BUT with caution! Initial Review: I have both Redux games. They both crash after the cell-shaded intro. The original Metro 2033 had the same issue. But the fix does not work on the Redux versions. 4A should havea done a BETTER job with QA the SECOND time re-releasing a game. I thought it was just ATI cards, but NVIDIA cards are affected by this physx issue! I am not alone in this, 38 pages and counting! /#p1 So buyer beware.

       "  (\"Specs: Intel DZ68BC Mobo i5 2500k *not overclocked* AMD XFX 7950 Double D 3Gb 8GB RAM Optimization: So, I was fortunate enough to not run into any crashing problems like most people are having. The game starts up and runs fine. I have only experienced it freeze once, but other than no problems. FPS on the other hand is a little unstable. Now, i'm not running this maxed out, but pretty damn close to it and at 1080P. There are times where my game runs pretty damn smooth, but it is not consistant. I believe i'm averaging around 40-50 FPS most of the time, but there are certain sections of the map where my FPS dips. Now, it's definitely not unplayable, but there are times when you can tell i'm hitting around 30FPS or so. This usually occurs in the sunset hills entrance where there are two buses with all the football player zombies. Story/Gameplay: I love Dead Rising and bought a Xbox 360 specifically for the first Dead Rising. Dead Rising 2 was also a great game and expanded with even more things. The first two games I believe had some great stories and psychopaths. Dead Rising 3 introduced Nick Ramos, who I found to be just as likeable as the other two protagonist from the first two games. Maybe it's just me, but I found the psychopaths a bit more believable in the first two games. Then again this is Dead Rising and things are a bit over the top. This game takes place 10 years after part 2 and If you have played all the games *including case west* then you will be suprised to see all the references from previous games. I did not play case west, but I don't believe it mattered that much as far as the story goes. With that being said, I don't think you're supposed to focus too much on Dead Rising's story. It's really not that hard to follow and the game sums up a lot too. The gameplay portion is what you would expect from Dead Rising. Thousands of zombies on screen and multiple ways to kill them. The introduction of combo vehicles makes things fun and interesting. The map can be a bit tricky to get around at first, but eventually you should learn how to navigate it quickly. Closing: I initially started playing on a keyboard and mouse, but quickly switched over to a controller. Don't get me wrong, it is playable, but I found it a lot more enjoyable and easier to play on a controller. I will say that I strongly believe this game needs a FOV option though. There were times where I would have much appreciated the ability to zoom out a little further from the default camera position. I strongly recommend removing the 30FPS lock as well. The game runs a lot well it did for me. If you're a Dead Rising fan, I would suggest trying this out. It's definitely a worthy sequel and is fun. With the recent release of patches, Capcom has improved stability a little bit more for me. I would assume that things can only get better from here.\",\n",

Everynow and then this is a game you can just pick up and have fun with if your anything like me. This review is all my opinion wich might be slightly biased due to nostalgianess hehe. or if I mistyped : This game has aged well if you compare it to indie games from nowadays, It doesnt stutter and the specs you need are uber low. Altho I like the style it is aged so well to me check out some gameplay if your not sure but for me its gotta be: 8/10 Gameplay: You have a top view car which can jump, roll, shoot, Go trough motha****** portals to explore diffrent (more hostile) worlds where you can sometimes do a small puzzle or a race for example. You gotta like the gameplay and wittyness that is in it. 9/10 Story: Not a too great FORCED buttttt If you take the effort to read all the dialoge you can get a clearer view, Sometimes you need to remember a cryptic statement to ease out a later puzzle world, But overall the story is how much you want to be drawn in by it. GREAT ROLEPLAYING GAME if you are into roleplaying, as there is no real storyline thats forced so you are like a blank slate since you start a game. 7/10 AN: I dont have alot to complain about this I hope FIXED version (my original NEVER would let me go trough the LAST FREAKKING PORTAL TO END IT LEGIT)Cheatcodes<<<< and multiplayer in this release While multiplayer I can live without Replaying the game with cheats was a fun thing to do to explore stuff. Verdict: I love the style, I love the execution even now for this classic. It should still be cheaper(LIKE 2,99 MAX) for the amount of time it would take to fully clear the game on a good run(without cheats sometimes you just get stuck in a run if you cannot find the right artifacts in the worlds) But if you are looking for a Nice racing/shooter with a unique feel that so many games seem to miss nowadays this is deffinatly a good one to pick up: = 8/10 TOTAL SCORE!

       "  (\"I've played dota 2 since the 3rd quarter of 2012. So I've had it for 2 1/4 years. Thats 19710 hours. Now lets assume you're supposed to have 8 hours of sleep every day, so i've been awake supposedly for 13140 hours of that time? Now further lets assume you go to full time education (like i did) and spend approximately 4 hours a day in school/university (on average). That leaves you with 9855 hours. So I've had 9855 hours of spare time in the last 2 and a bit years to study, get fit, get a girlfriend, find a job and get successful and this time also includes eating time and laying around doing nothing/watching tv time. I've spent 1/3 of my time playing Dota 2? Is it an amazing game? Absolutely. If I could go back and decide whether to start playing it? Hell no. About 3k hours in dota 2, and probably about hours in DotA. If i had done anything productive during that hours I would be pretty rich or happy with my self by now. But instead i'm fat and have no job and got horrible grades in uni so far. Now that was the disclaimer. Time to rate the game out of 10 for graphics, gameplay, storyline, replayability and then an overall score. Moba's are not usually played for graphics so much. The main focus of the game is on the actual gameplay, but in comparison to the other big 'moba' games, Dota 2 has quite good graphics. If you're looking for a visually amazing game you can spend time on, Dota 2 might not be the best choice, because its not really made for the graphics. If you want a moba with good graphics look at smite, dawngate or heroes of the storm (none of which i've played but their screenshots look like they have slightly better graphics than dota 2). Also, dota 2 has a few female characters but if your in it for the revealing type images of characters go play league of legends because you're probably gonna never load into a game without seeing bewbs. Graphics Score: 7/10 Gameplay. Dota 2 has amazing gameplay. After playing so many times i still feel like theres ever so little more i need to know because gameplay is changed slightly (or sometimes vastly) by patches. The patches are seeming to come more regularly (now 2 months in a row with 1 patch per month). The skills a dota 2 player needs to learn to be really great can take years and years to get good at. Reaction time isn't the only important thing but strategy and calculations are important. In comparison to LoL which is the only other moba i have played, Dota 2 has significantly more strategy involved in pub games. I play LoL game where people barely speak or plan out whats going on. In dota 2 there are so many tense occasions where you and your team have to roam the map and farm in a group and avoid smoke ganks. Other gameplay factors which enhance skill required is the timer system of jungle spawns (stacking, pulling), creep blocking, denying allied creeps (and heroes in some cases!) and the last most important thing is that whereas in LoL where a majority of heroes can solo kill others, you need to organise ganks very well with allies to get kills. Dota 2 takes a while to learn but the satisfaction is ever-present once you've gotten to a certain point. Gamplay Score: 10/10 Storyline. The lore in DotA was nice to learn about. The dota 2 lore is pretty bad and not really linked to the original game. Valve doesn't release any storyline related videos for dota 2 really. The advantage of this is that since the game has source film maker with it (i havent used sfm yet), a lot of talented people have created SFM videos on youtube which are really enjoyable to watch. Having said that if you want a game for its story I would not recommend dota 2 for that. Compared to games like smite and lol the character backgrounds aren't really important and many (including myself can't be bothered reading). The only story in the game is kind of a tutorial form which is nice for new players. Storyline Score: 4/10. Replayability. This is self explanatory. I have spent hour around for this game and DotA. It is probably one of the most replayable games ever made. You will almost never have 2 games with the exact same heroes and team (unless maybe in captains mode where you can ban and pick) and games can last between 10 mins and 1 and a half hours (some are faster or longer but this is the general sweet spot with the average (non-abandoned) game lasting about 40ish mins). Replayability Score: 10/10 Overall. Dota 2 lacks a little bit in the story area but this game was not meant for that. This game was made for literally endless fun and playing. This overall score will not be an average of the other scores but more of the total enjoyability of the game i've been hooked on for the last 7 years. Overall Score (not 10/10 because that would imply that its the most perfect game ever created, which i still think it could be a little bit better)\",\n",

       "  (\"X: Rebirth was meant to reboot the franchise in order for it to appeal to a greater amount of players. Egosoft meant to accomplish this by removing, fixing or adding features and streamlining them to be more accessible. Egosoft's promises, however, proved void. The 'X' series have always been beloved because it is virtually the only franchise that offers a complete sandbox experience in a singleplayer environment. A massive universe with a plethora of ships to fly and opportunities to pursue made the 'X' series a behemoth in space sandboxing. However, all this sandboxing always came with a price - a clunky, inaccessible game with a learn curve akin to a 90 degree angled wall sunked in grease and other lubricants, unfortunately doing away with most people giving the franchise a try. Again Egosoft promised it would tackle these problems. Hence, considering their past 15 years of experience, Egosoft was trusted that it could release the biggest, best and most accessible 'X' game to date. Unfortunately, they couldn't have been more wrong. In it's current state, Rebirth is an unplayable mess. Severe lack of optimisation, horrendous UI, atrocious character models, abysmal story, game breaking bugs, feature incomplete, frequent crashes and whatnot. If anything Rebirth is the epitome od unfinished products released to meet publisher enforced deadlines. It's amazing (give or take) seven years Egosoft brought a very promising and well-established franchise to its knees and even more amazing is how little they achieved with Rebirth. Not one design goal that was mentioned in their first announcement has been completed. Trading is utterly broken and even corrupts save game files, controlling AI ships has never been more tedious - regardless of what game we're looking at - horrendous performance on high-end systems show little to no interest in the PC market. If you have a midrange computer at your disposal most of the performance issues will not apply to you, however. While Egosoft has done everything it can to continously patch the game and we have seen a barrage of patches come our way, this game is not worth a purchase at all. Unfortunate as it might be and as pretty as the screenshots may be, the game is an utter and complete mess. For those coming back as veterans of the series, Rebirth has nothing to offer but instead is a step down from the sandbox that is X2/X3. For those coming to take a peek at the 'X' series, Rebirth could have been an excellent starting point to ease into the series, if it didn't come with so many bugs, glitches and crashes. If anything Rebirth is not your harbour if you are coming back or if you are just starting which is unfortunate, because when and if Rebirth works it's an absolutely gorgeous game (in space) and has a lot going for it. It's a step up from games such as Freelancer in both offering a sandbox and complete experience. It just turned out the be not the game Egosoft or its fans were hoping it'd be.\",\n",

Evolve is far better than the buggy messes companies seem to be getting away with lately. The game is fast paced and well designed. If your team is organised the game is extremely fun and playing as the monster is an experience like no other. Yet if the monster is sneaky (cough cough Wraith) then the game can turn into a sort of 'running simulator' if you will. But the fresh idea and the beautiful game that is Evolve more than makes up for this small problem. The game is definitely worth a buy!\",\n",

I really liked Classic and Modern Sonic as characters in this game and Time Eater was interesting before we saw the obvious reveal that the 'The Time Eater' was controlled by Eggman and the Robotnik. GAMEPLAY I must This is maybe the most fun I've had with a Sonic Game. I think the control is near perfect, the level design is interesting and not 'tunnel like'. It's a saferide that will give you a lot of pleasure if you are a Classic Veteran or a Modern Veteran(I can't say this for I started out with the Adventure But I still get enjoyment out of Modern and Classic Sonic) But I still think(For me atleast) Modern Sonic was more enjoyable, with all the speedrunning tricks and that speed. Sega got fast with this GRAPHICS 9/10 Graphics look really good. It looks better than Colors and is somewhere on the same level with Sonic Lost World. But it's still not as beatiful as Unleashed. But you can add Unleashed Graphics thanks to the Modding Community. MUSIC 10/10 This is a soundtrack I really enjoyed. All of the tracks were enjoyable and nostalgic giving it that Anniversary feel. My favourite tracks are Sky Sanctuary(all of them), Crisis City(Act 1) and City Escape. I also really enjoy Speed Highway Act 1. That track just sounds like it should be played in a Night Club and I love it :3 REPLAYABILITY 10/10 When the game is pretty fun to replay and I must say, one of the best thing about this game is the Modding Community. They work on outstanding mods and they do come out freaquently. So it's a perfect way to come back to the game and try out some awesome modifications people came up OVERALL SCORE: I really liked this game. But I wanted more from the Perfect Chaos Awesome\",\n",

Seriously though once i unlocked the kraken every game (played about 20+ with the kraken alone) became a 1 sided slaughter, which would make the goliath cry in a corner in shame. The kraken is so over powered you can even take on the hunters as they land without eating anything. I tested this a couple times to see if it was possible with, no armor from eating, just 2 points in lightning strike, 1 in vortex, easy. Its too mobile in the air, its too touph and its abilities do so much damage. I can't imagein it was very fun for the enemy team to get killed within the first minute of the game after the 50+ menu screens and load bars. Its like a million times better then the goliath and there is no reason to go back to the goliath once you unlock the kraken, unless you really like the play style. Goliath is balanced for the most part, Kraken is not. The game shows great promise though, they just need to do some more balanceing changes, reduce the amount of loading and menu screens etc. I didn't count it but i think the game goes through like 4/5 menus and load screens from clicking play on the main menu to getting in the game. I hope there is more to do then the standard 4v1 in 3 maps. Adding more hunters and monsters isn't enough, this game needs more modes and things to do other then VS mode. What made left 4 dead interesting for so long, was because of the long levels and varied play, with some small story elements. This has none of that. Typical games last less then 10 minutes, so there is alot of repetition and alot of running around a map looking for a monster or running away (unless your the Kraken). I will definatly play it at launch and open beta. I just hope there is more to the game by then and not just more hunters and monsters, or the game won't keep peoples interest for long.\",\n",

Defeinitely disppointed in the developers. Pros: Dinosaurs Actual hunting mechanics. Shoot a vital organ? Does more damage. Too many bad shots? You ruin the trophy. A very realistic game. You need to camoflauge, and survive against the dinosaurs. They'll also actively look for you through scene. Multiplayer is generally a friendly community. Cons: There's no more major updates as it looks like. Which effectively kills the game. Each 'pro' factor mentioned above is fun for about an hour or two, until it gets boring. The game can be fun if you play multiplayer, otherwise you're going to get bored quickly. Progression system sucks to begin with. You are given a makeshift machete, and will have to die repeatedly, maybe getting a kill in to progress. You progress by killing dinosaurs. If a dinosaur takes too much damage, it will run. It will run faster than you, and thus your melee attacks will render you incapable of getting a kill, halting your progression before it starts. Would not recommend.

      "Original: Mount & Blade: Warband is a game like none ever before. It is peerless, perfect and a true everlasting masterpiece. It is an open world sandbox medieval RPG large scale battle simulation. Start out as an unknown adventurer and rise to be one of the mightiest lords, if not a ruler, of the entire realm. Don't get put off by the dated visuals, the depth is infinite and Warband is one of the best ten games I have ever played in my entire life so far. (And I played thousands of them) What might start out as a confusing journey to some, becomes the pinnacle of immersement when you're riding with 200 knights along you into battle, singling out the enemy commander and killing him in single combat while dozens of arrows hit the ground next to you. I can't wait for Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord to finally finish development. It is personally my most expected game of the decade.\n",

I heard about a great soundtrack playing in the background, creating a nice atmosphere that carries you from hour to hour of playing. I heard about a neat art style, distinguishing itself from a lot of other games out there while still being nice to look at and sort of familiar. I heard about the difficulty to be decided by your skills/motiviations, ranging from experiencing the world without a sweat to giving you a challenge determined by your playstyle. I heard about a decent arsenal of different weapons, offering the chance to create your very own way to fight through the colorful world. And, last but not least, I heard that buying this game is definitely worth it, even though it's an Indie-Game created by a small amount of people. Well, I can say that small amount of people sure did manage to approve all the things I heard, creating a game that's definitely worth buying for its low price and decent amount of playtime (approx. 10h + possibitly of New Game Plus)\n",

For a game that packs 10gb of data you get a badly designed menu, badly designed weapons, badly designed sound effects, badly designed levels, lot of clipping issues, not to mention the game is laggy as hell.

Still, the plot is enough to give the gameplay some meaning and the shooting is great and simple, if a bit unpolished. The upgrade system is nice and the weapons are fairly varied, but some of the 'big' weapons you get later on really don't pack much of a punch; you'll likely find yourself mostly using the weapons from the first level. Overall, it's likely not worth the full price, but if you see it on sale or in a bundle, it wouldn't hurt to get it.\n",

Both sides seem to be pretty balanced, however humans seem to rely on teamwork a lot more (so crappy team mates make for a less than stellar game). The visuals are pretty impressive when turned on max settings. The dark areas, along with clutter makes the human play a little bit on edge at times. More frequent updates would be nice, the new 'dropable' skins are a nice touch. I also find that the community along with many other games can be pretty crappy at times, with a lot of trash talking. Matchmaking also is pretty rough sometimes especially when just starting, being a level 10 going against 2 level 100 sharks is pretty tough if you dont have a good team.\n",

So once i was 'set up', i've spent over 50 hours in the game and there are things that i felt were missing, and at the later end of the 50 hours i started feeling like i had burnt through all the content. Like i didn't find any new technologies, chats with alien races started getting So you might ask why i'm giving this a positive review? Mostly because damnitall i've had SO much fun in this game, exploring, and just beholding. It's beautiful. I also have high hopes for fixes and added content, if things go well, this will eventually be well worth the 59,99! Though i had hopes for Starforge aswell, so we'll see. Staying positive though.

      "Original: I will start by stating that I got this game for free for the sole purpose of testing and reviewing it. This game is not the normal type of game I review, and with that being said I recruited my girlfriend's help in this one. TL;DR is in the last section of review. The Game: The game itself was built in GameMaker, with a supposed 500 hours invested into the design. The music and all the art is original which is a solid change from some of the RPG Maker games I've seen. The fast-paced survival in Three Days works really well, against what I had originally anticipated actually. There is a real urgency in collecting resources but I did feel a bit thrown into the mix. The crafting in this game is also taken from a unique perspective. Think of the world as your inventory, you just simply drag and drop items on top of each other to create things. While a lot of the game is unfinished, I see a lot of potential in this, and believe it'll continue to be developed. The Developer: My hopes are very high when I see a developer actually talking with his players. Lueshie and I worked together for a bit to pin down some bugs, and I for one want to see more of that. He took all of what I said constructively and was very calm and polite throughout. Which I feel is quite absent in most developers. He's the kind of person you can see actually cares. As I spammed him with bugs and stuff I felt was obvious that was overlooked, he patiently updated his bug tracker and I watched as things I found were added to the list. The Girlfriend: One of the best things about this game so far is the crafting page. I looked at it after I made a spear by accident. I hate how fast the game goes, but it is understandable at this point in the games development. Killing the chickens was also very enjoyable after I learned how to kill them. Figuring out how to eat was a pain as well; I thought you could just drag and drop the food onto the character rather than click multiple times. Trying to use the spear to fish was a bit of a hassle. It would be awesome in the future to be able to customize the character as well. Conclusion (TL;DR) The game at it's core has an honest new take on an old idea. It's fun and refreshing to see this put into effect. This game was released today, so bugs on a new game are expected however and to be perfectly honest, some of the bugs are kinda fun to mess with. Overall a good experience, and funny to watch my girlfriend triumph over chickens.\n",

      "Original: Remember 'The Lost Vikings' from 1992? By the company famous for the massively successful online multiplayer RPG franchise, 'Rock 'n Roll Racing'? No? Where you alive back then? If not, then you have a temporary excuse. Before you continue reading this review, go to your nearest second-hand video game retailer and steal either a Super Nintendo or a time machine. If you stole the Super Nintendo, then also steal a copy of 'The Lost Vikings', and play it through to the end. If you stole a time machine, travel back to about 1984 and beg your parents to get it on a little earlier than scheduled so you can get a copy of 'The Lost Vikings' for your eighth birthday. Now that you know what to do, you have no more excuses. Go. When you're done playing through the game, come back. I'll be waiting. If you were alive in 1992, your only excuse is that you are an ignorant person. That is not a real excuse, but I forgive you for your ignorance. You can follow the same steps as the person who was not alive in 1992, but be careful--don't trip over your ignorance, or do something stupid while back in 1986 like betting all your money on the Red Sox. Alright. Done playing through 'The Lost Vikings'? 'Trine' is a lot like that. Slightly different abilities for your 'Vikings', and much better graphics, but for the most part, it's the same idea. Perhaps what makes it a little worse is that there are typically many glitchy solutions to individual puzzles (most involving either making a bunch of platforms with the wizard, or worm-jumping with the theif's grappling hook). What, never heard of worm-jumping? Were you alive/competent in 1997? See the above paragraphs, and replace 'The Lost Vikings' with 'Worms 2'. You'll thank me.\n",

The lighting really does make it feel 'enchanted' (enchanted edition). However, this alone is not what makes this game spectacular. It is the fact that there are so many creative ways in which you can complete puzzles and get about and around in the game that made me stick around. You play as 3 people whose souls are stuck in the Trine. If you play alone, then you have to switch out between the Wizard, the Thief, and the Warrior. Each character has different special abilities, giving you the opporunity to solve the same puzzles in so many different ways. As a gamer, it really makes you feel creative when you solve a difficult puzzle/climb a difficult part of a level in your own unique way. It is all up to you in how you will get around in the game, whether it be using the Thief's grappling hook or the wizard's floating platform (etc). This game is amazing because there are no limits and no standards to how you solve a puzzle/level. It is all up to your imagination :). This is definitely worth playing!\n",

      "Original: Just finished a playthrough and started new game + on my cleric. The game fairly long, standing at 15 hours with almost everything explored. As many have said, it connects dark souls-combat (albeit heavier) to a diabloish universe. The monster and item design was cool, and the numerous hidden secrets make for an interesting experience. Many of the boss fights were lovely, although the damage I inflicted upon them felt neglible and the overall length of the fight was very long, boss kills ranging from 3-10 minutes. However, seeing that the game itself focuses even more on windows of opportunity and the rare occasions of being able to load a combo (which many weapons have, interesting mix-ups of light and heavy attacks) on an enemy. The level design is also solid, feeling threatening, seeing closed portculli and doors right and left, only for you to find that it was a shortcut to the section or activated by a pressure plate. The entire scenario is very much a mix-up of the Painted World of Ariamis and the third act of Diablo 3. I will be honest in my opinion that there was room for improvement at times, regarding the story, characters, overall itemization and ranged combat. Most of the times when I hit a brick wall in terms of multiple monsters or a strong individual one, I resorted to spam projectiles with my gauntlet (which uses mana as a resource and allows you to deal dmg from afar, and through a shield in most cases) killing them as easily as a ranged fighter in Souls games in general. The game left me asking for more, even though the ending itself was quite weird and basically left a chance for a season pass to come, and there still are several things I want to see regarding hidden gems like alternate boss kill challenges and what happens if I choose otherwise at sidequests. The game was very stable on me, and I only experienced minor lag during a session of multiple hours, although the loading screens and transitions were quite long. I will be on lookout for the announced puzzle-oriented Library DLC, and wish the best for those who have poor experiences with the game regarding performance issues. Overall, I rate graphics(played on high with a stable 30-40 fps) 9/10 Story and characters 6,5/10 Gameplay 8/10 Souls feels 8/10 would bang bringing the total score to 8/10\n",

However, where the first game felt perfunctory in its storytelling and world building, the sequel goes to great lengths at making this more entertaining. Stephen Merchant and Simmons lend their considerable voice talent, and along with some brilliant set pieces set to an equally brilliant score, the game is full of life where the first game felt thin and minimalist. The increased production values are the most immediate and tangible improvement, but the new toys on hand also bring with them fresh challenges that really stretch the possibilities of 3D puzzle solving, but never to the point where things become too demanding (this of course will vary with your own observational and spatial awareness). The '2' in Portal 2 also hints at a fully developed co-op mode, among some of the best. The solo campaign would've been worth the price of admission, but a fully realized series of challenges tailored for two is really just The Best Thing. There's also Steam Workshop support, so replay value really becomes a moot factor, because it is potentially infinite. I really, really like this game, if it wasn't obvious already.\n",

Where do I start?! The sound, well, it is just, bad? The voice acting, the quality of the voice recording, the sound levels, the guns, the dino's, the music that cuts in and out. All pretty bad. Not horrible, but it is kind of like they just dumped a bunch of stuff in there, DONE! The Animations are just plain weird and buggy. Your main starting gun, when you draw it, is drawn before your hands are in position. What?! The scope zooming is done like this is a game from 2007. The Dino's jumping animation is bad, the bites are wayyy off, flying dino's make insane 180's midair, the T Rex takes weird bites from the ground and proceeds to trow these 'boulders' at They spin and are only half animated, one side is just flat. Did they ever take a look at this game? Did they even test it and play it themselves? Physics, well, ehh. Yes, Shoot a 10 ton Stegosaurus with a bow and arrow for 20 times and it dies, but the last arrow sends it flying like crazy. But a tank shell on a minature critter has no impact. Oh and did you know, dino's can pound the ground and send you flying off into the air, but their own kind is just glued to the floor. And then the actual gameplay. Did they ever test it? What where they thinking? You are teleported out of fortified buildings when the enemies come in. Never heard of using bunkers I guess. You NEED the jetpack, if you don't have it you are just picked up and dropped to death. And fightning from a rock is way to go. So why are there 3 classes? It won't help if they don't get something like the Jetpack. So you defend this generator, that has no healthbar and needs to be recharged. You get random vehicles for liberating outposts but it all has very arbitrary time constraints. These game modes just make NO SENSE AT ALL. 3/10, would not play if F2P.

Initial Review: I have both Redux games. They both crash after the cell-shaded intro. The original Metro 2033 had the same issue. But the fix does not work on the Redux versions. 4A should havea done a BETTER job with QA the SECOND time re-releasing a game. I thought it was just ATI cards, but NVIDIA cards are affected by this physx issue! I am not alone in this, 38 pages and counting! /#p1 So buyer beware. I hope they fix this, but then again they didn't fix it the first time around! I guess I'll count myself as a sucker for buying twice eh!\n",

      "Original: This is a really good dragonball z game. It had features like a huge selection of characters and even customizable characters which are things I could only dream about when I was a kid and a huge dragonball z fan playing the old super nintendo dragonball z games. There were a couple things I didn't like about this game, the music is pretty bad especially for the lobby and menus. The japanese opening theme when you start the game was pretty cool though. I also really didn't like the voice acting for a lot of the characters, especially some of my favourite characters, but dragonball z has had a long history of bad voice acting and changing voice actors so it has become expected for me and I try to ignore it and hope for a day where they finally do it right.\n",

      "Original: It's basically Dark Souls with much better graphics and toned-down difficulty. Still, Lords Of The Fallen is a great game. It took me about 17h to complete and the game crashed only once, so I guess I was lucky :) + Stunning graphics. + Runs smoothly, 60fps@1080p all the time, all maxed. + The combat is simple, yet stellar, with a feeling of weight. + Decent length. + Armor design is superb, they look seriously badass! - Too easy. The bosses in particular. - The boss design is boring, practically every boss is a dude with a sword - Clunky animations, especially the characters. - Not much to explore, the game is much more linear than Dark Souls. All and all, Lords of the Fallen was a good game and I can recommend it to anyone who likes the whole Dark Souls - style of gameplay and genre. 8/10\n",

      "Original: Specs: Intel DZ68BC Mobo i5 2500k *not overclocked* AMD XFX 7950 Double D 3Gb 8GB RAM Optimization: So, I was fortunate enough to not run into any crashing problems like most people are having. The game starts up and runs fine. I have only experienced it freeze once, but other than no problems. FPS on the other hand is a little unstable. Now, i'm not running this maxed out, but pretty damn close to it and at 1080P. There are times where my game runs pretty damn smooth, but it is not consistant. I believe i'm averaging around 40-50 FPS most of the time, but there are certain sections of the map where my FPS dips. Now, it's definitely not unplayable, but there are times when you can tell i'm hitting around 30FPS or so. This usually occurs in the sunset hills entrance where there are two buses with all the football player zombies. Story/Gameplay: I love Dead Rising and bought a Xbox 360 specifically for the first Dead Rising. Dead Rising 2 was also a great game and expanded with even more things. The first two games I believe had some great stories and psychopaths. Dead Rising 3 introduced Nick Ramos, who I found to be just as likeable as the other two protagonist from the first two games. Maybe it's just me, but I found the psychopaths a bit more believable in the first two games. Then again this is Dead Rising and things are a bit over the top. This game takes place 10 years after part 2 and If you have played all the games *including case west* then you will be suprised to see all the references from previous games. I did not play case west, but I don't believe it mattered that much as far as the story goes. With that being said, I don't think you're supposed to focus too much on Dead Rising's story. It's really not that hard to follow and the game sums up a lot too. The gameplay portion is what you would expect from Dead Rising. Thousands of zombies on screen and multiple ways to kill them. The introduction of combo vehicles makes things fun and interesting. The map can be a bit tricky to get around at first, but eventually you should learn how to navigate it quickly. Closing: I initially started playing on a keyboard and mouse, but quickly switched over to a controller. Don't get me wrong, it is playable, but I found it a lot more enjoyable and easier to play on a controller. I will say that I strongly believe this game needs a FOV option though. There were times where I would have much appreciated the ability to zoom out a little further from the default camera position. I strongly recommend removing the 30FPS lock as well. The game runs a lot well it did for me. If you're a Dead Rising fan, I would suggest trying this out. It's definitely a worthy sequel and is fun. With the recent release of patches, Capcom has improved stability a little bit more for me. I would assume that things can only get better from here.\n",

The impact effects make hitting every enemy satisfying and you will constantly feel like a badass regardless of how hard the actual stage is. The gameplay, like the artstyle, is minimalistic but satifying none the less. It can get quite challenging as the later stages tend to get hectic (especially at higher speed levels). The game can get wuite addictive when you try to get a perfect on all stages Overall the game feels amazing and you won't really understand its appeal unless you actually try it yourself.

      "Original: Amazing game, Love the gameplay even after all these years (originally bought it in a discount bin with like 14 others back in 1998). Everynow and then this is a game you can just pick up and have fun with if your anything like me. This review is all my opinion wich might be slightly biased due to nostalgianess hehe. or if I mistyped : This game has aged well if you compare it to indie games from nowadays, It doesnt stutter and the specs you need are uber low. Altho I like the style it is aged so well to me check out some gameplay if your not sure but for me its gotta be: 8/10 Gameplay: You have a top view car which can jump, roll, shoot, Go trough motha****** portals to explore diffrent (more hostile) worlds where you can sometimes do a small puzzle or a race for example. You gotta like the gameplay and wittyness that is in it. 9/10 Story: Not a too great FORCED buttttt If you take the effort to read all the dialoge you can get a clearer view, Sometimes you need to remember a cryptic statement to ease out a later puzzle world, But overall the story is how much you want to be drawn in by it. GREAT ROLEPLAYING GAME if you are into roleplaying, as there is no real storyline thats forced so you are like a blank slate since you start a game. 7/10 AN: I dont have alot to complain about this I hope FIXED version (my original NEVER would let me go trough the LAST FREAKKING PORTAL TO END IT LEGIT)Cheatcodes<<<< and multiplayer in this release While multiplayer I can live without Replaying the game with cheats was a fun thing to do to explore stuff. Verdict: I love the style, I love the execution even now for this classic. It should still be cheaper(LIKE 2,99 MAX) for the amount of time it would take to fully clear the game on a good run(without cheats sometimes you just get stuck in a run if you cannot find the right artifacts in the worlds) But if you are looking for a Nice racing/shooter with a unique feel that so many games seem to miss nowadays this is deffinatly a good one to pick up: = 8/10 TOTAL SCORE! ITS A CLASSIC :3 ~epic\n",

      "Original: I've played dota 2 since the 3rd quarter of 2012. So I've had it for 2 1/4 years. Thats 19710 hours. Now lets assume you're supposed to have 8 hours of sleep every day, so i've been awake supposedly for 13140 hours of that time? Now further lets assume you go to full time education (like i did) and spend approximately 4 hours a day in school/university (on average). That leaves you with 9855 hours. So I've had 9855 hours of spare time in the last 2 and a bit years to study, get fit, get a girlfriend, find a job and get successful and this time also includes eating time and laying around doing nothing/watching tv time. I've spent 1/3 of my time playing Dota 2? Is it an amazing game? Absolutely. If I could go back and decide whether to start playing it? Hell no. About 3k hours in dota 2, and probably about hours in DotA. If i had done anything productive during that hours I would be pretty rich or happy with my self by now. But instead i'm fat and have no job and got horrible grades in uni so far. Now that was the disclaimer. Time to rate the game out of 10 for graphics, gameplay, storyline, replayability and then an overall score. Moba's are not usually played for graphics so much. The main focus of the game is on the actual gameplay, but in comparison to the other big 'moba' games, Dota 2 has quite good graphics. If you're looking for a visually amazing game you can spend time on, Dota 2 might not be the best choice, because its not really made for the graphics. If you want a moba with good graphics look at smite, dawngate or heroes of the storm (none of which i've played but their screenshots look like they have slightly better graphics than dota 2). Also, dota 2 has a few female characters but if your in it for the revealing type images of characters go play league of legends because you're probably gonna never load into a game without seeing bewbs. Graphics Score: 7/10 Gameplay. Dota 2 has amazing gameplay. After playing so many times i still feel like theres ever so little more i need to know because gameplay is changed slightly (or sometimes vastly) by patches. The patches are seeming to come more regularly (now 2 months in a row with 1 patch per month). The skills a dota 2 player needs to learn to be really great can take years and years to get good at. Reaction time isn't the only important thing but strategy and calculations are important. In comparison to LoL which is the only other moba i have played, Dota 2 has significantly more strategy involved in pub games. I play LoL game where people barely speak or plan out whats going on. In dota 2 there are so many tense occasions where you and your team have to roam the map and farm in a group and avoid smoke ganks. Other gameplay factors which enhance skill required is the timer system of jungle spawns (stacking, pulling), creep blocking, denying allied creeps (and heroes in some cases!) and the last most important thing is that whereas in LoL where a majority of heroes can solo kill others, you need to organise ganks very well with allies to get kills. Dota 2 takes a while to learn but the satisfaction is ever-present once you've gotten to a certain point. Gamplay Score: 10/10 Storyline. The lore in DotA was nice to learn about. The dota 2 lore is pretty bad and not really linked to the original game. Valve doesn't release any storyline related videos for dota 2 really. The advantage of this is that since the game has source film maker with it (i havent used sfm yet), a lot of talented people have created SFM videos on youtube which are really enjoyable to watch. Having said that if you want a game for its story I would not recommend dota 2 for that. Compared to games like smite and lol the character backgrounds aren't really important and many (including myself can't be bothered reading). The only story in the game is kind of a tutorial form which is nice for new players. Storyline Score: 4/10. Replayability. This is self explanatory. I have spent hour around for this game and DotA. It is probably one of the most replayable games ever made. You will almost never have 2 games with the exact same heroes and team (unless maybe in captains mode where you can ban and pick) and games can last between 10 mins and 1 and a half hours (some are faster or longer but this is the general sweet spot with the average (non-abandoned) game lasting about 40ish mins). Replayability Score: 10/10 Overall. Dota 2 lacks a little bit in the story area but this game was not meant for that. This game was made for literally endless fun and playing. This overall score will not be an average of the other scores but more of the total enjoyability of the game i've been hooked on for the last 7 years. Overall Score (not 10/10 because that would imply that its the most perfect game ever created, which i still think it could be a little bit better)\n",

      "Original: X: Rebirth was meant to reboot the franchise in order for it to appeal to a greater amount of players. Egosoft meant to accomplish this by removing, fixing or adding features and streamlining them to be more accessible. Egosoft's promises, however, proved void. The 'X' series have always been beloved because it is virtually the only franchise that offers a complete sandbox experience in a singleplayer environment. A massive universe with a plethora of ships to fly and opportunities to pursue made the 'X' series a behemoth in space sandboxing. However, all this sandboxing always came with a price - a clunky, inaccessible game with a learn curve akin to a 90 degree angled wall sunked in grease and other lubricants, unfortunately doing away with most people giving the franchise a try. Again Egosoft promised it would tackle these problems. Hence, considering their past 15 years of experience, Egosoft was trusted that it could release the biggest, best and most accessible 'X' game to date. Unfortunately, they couldn't have been more wrong. In it's current state, Rebirth is an unplayable mess. Severe lack of optimisation, horrendous UI, atrocious character models, abysmal story, game breaking bugs, feature incomplete, frequent crashes and whatnot. If anything Rebirth is the epitome od unfinished products released to meet publisher enforced deadlines. It's amazing (give or take) seven years Egosoft brought a very promising and well-established franchise to its knees and even more amazing is how little they achieved with Rebirth. Not one design goal that was mentioned in their first announcement has been completed. Trading is utterly broken and even corrupts save game files, controlling AI ships has never been more tedious - regardless of what game we're looking at - horrendous performance on high-end systems show little to no interest in the PC market. If you have a midrange computer at your disposal most of the performance issues will not apply to you, however. While Egosoft has done everything it can to continously patch the game and we have seen a barrage of patches come our way, this game is not worth a purchase at all. Unfortunate as it might be and as pretty as the screenshots may be, the game is an utter and complete mess. For those coming back as veterans of the series, Rebirth has nothing to offer but instead is a step down from the sandbox that is X2/X3. For those coming to take a peek at the 'X' series, Rebirth could have been an excellent starting point to ease into the series, if it didn't come with so many bugs, glitches and crashes. If anything Rebirth is not your harbour if you are coming back or if you are just starting which is unfortunate, because when and if Rebirth works it's an absolutely gorgeous game (in space) and has a lot going for it. It's a step up from games such as Freelancer in both offering a sandbox and complete experience. It just turned out the be not the game Egosoft or its fans were hoping it'd be.\n",

This game feels like it 'missing elements' to it that kill the appeal to me. It's a bullet hell one moment and a race the next. In my last review, I though Our Darker Purpose was difficult, but really I wasn't playing well due to the lack of reward for really doing so. You can get treasure, items, coins, loot and grades on how well you did - but NONE of that seems rewarding enough to turn the satisfaction of getting such things into In a sense, there is no penalty for losing in this game, you get to keep the rewards from floor grades anyway. I don't recommend this game to people who want a more thrilling exciting experience in their rogue-like games. This game executes it's purpose well - being dull, being depressing, and being dark. 6/10 but not my kind of \n",

She told me it was because we didnt finish the tutorial. I still haven't figured out if i have finished that tutorial or not. I got a few missions first that i finished. One race event and the other one that i didnt understand. The other play kept shooting at me for some reason and that made him win. In the end i decided to drive around him till he eventually left the event. That kinda made me win. After that i didnt got any phonecalls anymore and random events are showing up. Wich all are kinda all about shooting and other stuff. I stole kinda every car or bike that i could found near me but after a while driviing around with a i got bored with that as well. I had enough money to buy a house or something, but the game didnt let me. because i can only buy a house if i get a call from simon. Who ever that is. All the missions are multi player, what is okay but with some you have to shoot the other player or something. Also there are not a lot of race events, it is a bit about shooting with a pistol. I geusse it is okay if you are into that. To be short, i find it overal boring. i think it would be more fun if there was a goal in this game besides stealing stuff.\n",

The game isn't one, sure there are simalarities, however sence there are in truth no bosses of the overworld to Minecraft (save for the use of mods), this is a game that has bosses that one must beat in order to progress through the game. The first one is just a nusence and not tough at all The Eye of Cuthulu, equaly during the Slime rain (requirments I think are Heath at 160, and you have blue and green slime banners) Slime King. EoC (Requires 200 heath and at least 3 npc's) I feel is best to at least have Iron/Lead armor before taking him on. The Destroyer of Worlds/Brain of Cuthulu I suggjest Silver/Tungston armor, this boss requisres you to destroy Shadow Orbs/Crimson Orbs 3 times to awaken. Just make sure you are ready to face it. One is a gigantic worm like creature and roughly you need a wepon to stirke multiple times. The other is you guessed it A giganitic brain that flys around shooting out fleash colored blobs. Each are around 8000-16000 health again not very though. This is just an example of what you are looking at while playing this game and these are just the first 2 bosses that one faces in the game.

It's unfortunately pandered to hunters who couldn't play the game effectively, so now it's easier for them, just point, shoot and spam as many perks as possible that you've paid through the nose for. Hunters are faster than monsters, trapping is no longer a skill, sneaking is pointless and dome's are endless. I was never a massive fan of Arena anyway, now it's basically the only game mode playable. It's not just the monster side that has been let down, what the hell happened to the whole dynamic of supports cloaking teammates? Really big shame, I'll move onto Ark:Survival Evolved and try my luck there. Farewell Evolve, I'll remember you how you were, not what's been done to you now!\n",

      "Original: Dear average consumer, Please do not be lured into the treacherous snares of the online trolls. Many people are screaming DAY 1 DLC!!! This is not the case. Everything that can currently be bought for the game is 100% purely cosmetic. Yup, all of it. Day 1 DLC? Doesn't Side note: Only take the reviews of those who actually own the game into consideration. All those 'Pre-Release' guys haven't played the actual game and have put 10 minutes into the unfinished copy yet can still wright legitimate reviews. Very silly indeed. On to the game, Evolve is a great game, simply put. It ticks all the average gamers boxes. 1. Enjoyable with friends? Yes 2. Day 1 DLC? Nope 3. Lots of content? Is 12 hunters 4 gamemodes and several maps not enough people! 4. Plus this game is no more expensive than any other current mainstream 'next-gen' title. The gameplay is smooth and runs like pure silk on my PC. There are minor bugs, but to be fair the game was released only a week ago and they are giving us a large patch fairly soon. Evolve is far better than the buggy messes companies seem to be getting away with lately. The game is fast paced and well designed. If your team is organised the game is extremely fun and playing as the monster is an experience like no other. Yet if the monster is sneaky (cough cough Wraith) then the game can turn into a sort of 'running simulator' if you will. But the fresh idea and the beautiful game that is Evolve more than makes up for this small problem. The game is definitely worth a buy!\n",

Do I like this Game? Yes! Do I like that you prefer fixing bugs on PS and Xbox first? No! Do I like that there isnt always a Splitscreen mode on PC (MW2 / BO2) ?

There are absolutely no options in the game. No resolution control, key binding only volume control. The camera is extremely zoomed in, to the point where it feels like you have no idea where you're actually going. I have to constantly use the speed boost in order to see the game I want to see it. Given the game's name it leads to believe that it's the 3rd game in a series however they still couldn't implement some basic options to tweak the game so it fits the player's needs or actually learn from other games of the genre how to make a good game? Combat isn't fun, through and through. Driving isn't fun, at all. Your car flies around randomly when it hits things, levels aren't fun and are extremely short. And best of all, don't you just love violent car battle games like this with no human model inside the car? Yea, the veichle is driven by an invisible The game just screams incomplete. I honestly have more fun and find more visually appealing to play Carmageddon 1, a game from 1997. Overall 3/10 don't buy this, better waste your money on something better.\n",

      "Original: Sonic Generations Review by nikfan PLOT 6/10 I liked the plot of this But it was really short and was not going anywhere! I really liked Classic and Modern Sonic as characters in this game and Time Eater was interesting before we saw the obvious reveal that the 'The Time Eater' was controlled by Eggman and the Robotnik. GAMEPLAY I must This is maybe the most fun I've had with a Sonic Game. I think the control is near perfect, the level design is interesting and not 'tunnel like'. It's a saferide that will give you a lot of pleasure if you are a Classic Veteran or a Modern Veteran(I can't say this for I started out with the Adventure But I still get enjoyment out of Modern and Classic Sonic) But I still think(For me atleast) Modern Sonic was more enjoyable, with all the speedrunning tricks and that speed. Sega got fast with this GRAPHICS 9/10 Graphics look really good. It looks better than Colors and is somewhere on the same level with Sonic Lost World. But it's still not as beatiful as Unleashed. But you can add Unleashed Graphics thanks to the Modding Community. MUSIC 10/10 This is a soundtrack I really enjoyed. All of the tracks were enjoyable and nostalgic giving it that Anniversary feel. My favourite tracks are Sky Sanctuary(all of them), Crisis City(Act 1) and City Escape. I also really enjoy Speed Highway Act 1. That track just sounds like it should be played in a Night Club and I love it :3 REPLAYABILITY 10/10 When the game is pretty fun to replay and I must say, one of the best thing about this game is the Modding Community. They work on outstanding mods and they do come out freaquently. So it's a perfect way to come back to the game and try out some awesome modifications people came up OVERALL SCORE: I really liked this game. But I wanted more from the Perfect Chaos Awesome\n",

      "Original: This is my review of the Evolve Alpha. Kraken OP. Thats it. Seriously though once i unlocked the kraken every game (played about 20+ with the kraken alone) became a 1 sided slaughter, which would make the goliath cry in a corner in shame. The kraken is so over powered you can even take on the hunters as they land without eating anything. I tested this a couple times to see if it was possible with, no armor from eating, just 2 points in lightning strike, 1 in vortex, easy. Its too mobile in the air, its too touph and its abilities do so much damage. I can't imagein it was very fun for the enemy team to get killed within the first minute of the game after the 50+ menu screens and load bars. Its like a million times better then the goliath and there is no reason to go back to the goliath once you unlock the kraken, unless you really like the play style. Goliath is balanced for the most part, Kraken is not. The game shows great promise though, they just need to do some more balanceing changes, reduce the amount of loading and menu screens etc. I didn't count it but i think the game goes through like 4/5 menus and load screens from clicking play on the main menu to getting in the game. I hope there is more to do then the standard 4v1 in 3 maps. Adding more hunters and monsters isn't enough, this game needs more modes and things to do other then VS mode. What made left 4 dead interesting for so long, was because of the long levels and varied play, with some small story elements. This has none of that. Typical games last less then 10 minutes, so there is alot of repetition and alot of running around a map looking for a monster or running away (unless your the Kraken). I will definatly play it at launch and open beta. I just hope there is more to the game by then and not just more hunters and monsters, or the game won't keep peoples interest for long.\n",

      "Original: Save yourself $32 CAD, and go buy Ark: Survival Evolved. theHunter: Primal was released before the defined date by the developers. The intentionally cut the game short to release 'version which only has five dinosaur species. It honestly sounds like the game isn't getting anymore major patches either. Defeinitely disppointed in the developers. Pros: Dinosaurs Actual hunting mechanics. Shoot a vital organ? Does more damage. Too many bad shots? You ruin the trophy. A very realistic game. You need to camoflauge, and survive against the dinosaurs. They'll also actively look for you through scene. Multiplayer is generally a friendly community. Cons: There's no more major updates as it looks like. Which effectively kills the game. Each 'pro' factor mentioned above is fun for about an hour or two, until it gets boring. The game can be fun if you play multiplayer, otherwise you're going to get bored quickly. Progression system sucks to begin with. You are given a makeshift machete, and will have to die repeatedly, maybe getting a kill in to progress. You progress by killing dinosaurs. If a dinosaur takes too much damage, it will run. It will run faster than you, and thus your melee attacks will render you incapable of getting a kill, halting your progression before it starts. Would not recommend. I did a first-impression to the game if anyone is interested. YouTube™ Video: First Plays - theHunter: Primal \n",

So once i was 'set up', i've spent over 50 hours in the game and there are things that i felt were missing, and at the later end of the 50 hours i started feeling like i had burnt through all the content. Like i didn't find any new technologies, chats with alien races started getting So you might ask why i'm giving this a positive review? Mostly because damnitall i've had SO much fun in this game, exploring, and just beholding. It's beautiful. I also have high hopes for fixes and added content, if things go well, this will eventually be well worth the 59,99! Though i had hopes for Starforge aswell, so we'll see. Staying positive though.

The visual aspect of the game is just gorgeous. The lighting really does make it feel 'enchanted' (enchanted edition). However, this alone is not what makes this game spectacular. It is the fact that there are so many creative ways in which you can complete puzzles and get about and around in the game that made me stick around. You play as 3 people whose souls are stuck in the Trine. If you play alone, then you have to switch out between the Wizard, the Thief, and the Warrior. Each character has different special abilities, giving you the opporunity to solve the same puzzles in so many different ways. As a gamer, it really makes you feel creative when you solve a difficult puzzle/climb a difficult part of a level in your own unique way. It is all up to you in how you will get around in the game, whether it be using the Thief's grappling hook or the wizard's floating platform (etc). This game is amazing because there are no limits and no standards to how you solve a puzzle/level. It is all up to your imagination :). This is definitely worth playing!\",\n",
       "    \"I will start by stating that I got this game for free for the sole purpose of testing and reviewing it. This game is not the normal type of game I review, and with that being said I recruited my girlfriend's help in this one. TL;DR is in the last section of review. The Game: The game itself was built in GameMaker, with a supposed 500 hours invested into the design. The music and all the art is original which is a solid change from some of the RPG Maker games I've seen. The fast-paced survival in Three Days works really well, against what I had originally anticipated actually. There is a real urgency in collecting resources but I did feel a bit thrown into the mix. The crafting in this game is also taken from a unique perspective. Think of the world as your inventory, you just simply drag and drop items on top of each other to create things. While a lot of the game is unfinished, I see a lot of potential in this, and believe it'll continue to be developed. The Developer: My hopes are very high when I see a developer actually talking with his players. Lueshie and I worked together for a bit to pin down some bugs, and I for one want to see more of that. He took all of what I said constructively and was very calm and polite throughout. Which I feel is quite absent in most developers. He's the kind of person you can see actually cares. As I spammed him with bugs and stuff I felt was obvious that was overlooked, he patiently updated his bug tracker and I watched as things I found were added to the list. The Girlfriend: One of the best things about this game so far is the crafting page. I looked at it after I made a spear by accident. I hate how fast the game goes, but it is understandable at this point in the games development. Killing the chickens was also very enjoyable after I learned how to kill them. Figuring out how to eat was a pain as well; I thought you could just drag and drop the food onto the character rather than click multiple times. Trying to use the spear to fish was a bit of a hassle. It would be awesome in the future to be able to customize the character as well. Conclusion (TL;DR) The game at it's core has an honest new take on an old idea. It's fun and refreshing to see this put into effect. This game was released today, so bugs on a new game are expected however and to be perfectly honest, some of the bugs are kinda fun to mess with. Overall a good experience, and funny to watch my girlfriend triumph over chickens.\"],\n",

Many of the boss fights were lovely, although the damage I inflicted upon them felt neglible and the overall length of the fight was very long, boss kills ranging from 3-10 minutes. However, seeing that the game itself focuses even more on windows of opportunity and the rare occasions of being able to load a combo (which many weapons have, interesting mix-ups of light and heavy attacks) on an enemy. The level design is also solid, feeling threatening, seeing closed portculli and doors right and left, only for you to find that it was a shortcut to the section or activated by a pressure plate. The entire scenario is very much a mix-up of the Painted World of Ariamis and the third act of Diablo 3. I will be honest in my opinion that there was room for improvement at times, regarding the story, characters, overall itemization and ranged combat. Most of the times when I hit a brick wall in terms of multiple monsters or a strong individual one, I resorted to spam projectiles with my gauntlet (which uses mana as a resource and allows you to deal dmg from afar, and through a shield in most cases) killing them as easily as a ranged fighter in Souls games in general. The game left me asking for more, even though the ending itself was quite weird and basically left a chance for a season pass to come, and there still are several things I want to see regarding hidden gems like alternate boss kill challenges and what happens if I choose otherwise at sidequests.

The central mechanic of traversing via portals is still novel, still genius. However, where the first game felt perfunctory in its storytelling and world building, the sequel goes to great lengths at making this more entertaining. Stephen Merchant and Simmons lend their considerable voice talent, and along with some brilliant set pieces set to an equally brilliant score, the game is full of life where the first game felt thin and minimalist. The increased production values are the most immediate and tangible improvement, but the new toys on hand also bring with them fresh challenges that really stretch the possibilities of 3D puzzle solving, but never to the point where things become too demanding (this of course will vary with your own observational and spatial awareness). The '2' in Portal 2 also hints at a fully developed co-op mode, among some of the best. The solo campaign would've been worth the price of admission, but a fully realized series of challenges tailored for two is really just The Best Thing. There's also Steam Workshop support, so replay value really becomes a moot factor, because it is potentially infinite. I really, really like this game, if it wasn't obvious already.\",\n",

The central mechanic of traversing via portals is still novel, still genius. However, where the first game felt perfunctory in its storytelling and world building, the sequel goes to great lengths at making this more entertaining. Stephen Merchant and Simmons lend their considerable voice talent, and along with some brilliant set pieces set to an equally brilliant score, the game is full of life where the first game felt thin and minimalist. The increased production values are the most immediate and tangible improvement, but the new toys on hand also bring with them fresh challenges that really stretch the possibilities of 3D puzzle solving, but never to the point where things become too demanding (this of course will vary with your own observational and spatial awareness). The '2' in Portal 2 also hints at a fully developed co-op mode, among some of the best. The solo campaign would've been worth the price of admission, but a fully realized series of challenges tailored for two is really just The Best Thing. There's also Steam Workshop support, so replay value really becomes a moot factor, because it is potentially infinite. I really, really like this game, if it wasn't obvious already.\",\n",

Lo and behold! both games work now! Good on 4A to fix things. I hope other people who had the same issue as me have the games working now. Playing the first part of 2033 Redux reminds me of the original Metro LL in terms of graphics, and the game seems smoother than the original. I still had to hack the config files to fix the crappy FOV. Just like the originals. So I'll only recommend both games for people who haven't played the Metro Series before. BUT with caution! Initial Review: I have both Redux games. They both crash after the cell-shaded intro. The original Metro 2033 had the same issue. But the fix does not work on the Redux versions. 4A should havea done a BETTER job with QA the SECOND time re-releasing a game. I thought it was just ATI cards, but NVIDIA cards are affected by this physx issue! I am not alone in this, 38 pages and counting! /#p1 So buyer beware. I hope they fix this, but then again they didn't fix it the first time around! I guess I'll count myself as a sucker for buying twice eh!\",\n",

Now, i'm not running this maxed out, but pretty damn close to it and at 1080P. There are times where my game runs pretty damn smooth, but it is not consistant. I believe i'm averaging around 40-50 FPS most of the time, but there are certain sections of the map where my FPS dips. Now, it's definitely not unplayable, but there are times when you can tell i'm hitting around 30FPS or so. This usually occurs in the sunset hills entrance where there are two buses with all the football player zombies. Story/Gameplay: I love Dead Rising and bought a Xbox 360 specifically for the first Dead Rising. Dead Rising 2 was also a great game and expanded with even more things. The first two games I believe had some great stories and psychopaths. Dead Rising 3 introduced Nick Ramos, who I found to be just as likeable as the other two protagonist from the first two games. Maybe it's just me, but I found the psychopaths a bit more believable in the first two games. Then again this is Dead Rising and things are a bit over the top.

I did not play case west, but I don't believe it mattered that much as far as the story goes. With that being said, I don't think you're supposed to focus too much on Dead Rising's story. It's really not that hard to follow and the game sums up a lot too. The gameplay portion is what you would expect from Dead Rising. Thousands of zombies on screen and multiple ways to kill them. The introduction of combo vehicles makes things fun and interesting. The map can be a bit tricky to get around at first, but eventually you should learn how to navigate it quickly. Closing: I initially started playing on a keyboard and mouse, but quickly switched over to a controller. Don't get me wrong, it is playable, but I found it a lot more enjoyable and easier to play on a controller. I will say that I strongly believe this game needs a FOV option though. There were times where I would have much appreciated the ability to zoom out a little further from the default camera position. I strongly recommend removing the 30FPS lock as well. The game runs a lot well it did for me. If you're a Dead Rising fan, I would suggest trying this out. It's definitely a worthy sequel and is fun.

The impact effects make hitting every enemy satisfying and you will constantly feel like a badass regardless of how hard the actual stage is. The gameplay, like the artstyle, is minimalistic but satifying none the less. It can get quite challenging as the later stages tend to get hectic (especially at higher speed levels). The game can get wuite addictive when you try to get a perfect on all stages Overall the game feels amazing and you won't really understand its appeal unless you actually try it yourself.

Altho I like the style it is aged so well to me check out some gameplay if your not sure but for me its gotta be: 8/10 Gameplay: You have a top view car which can jump, roll, shoot, Go trough motha****** portals to explore diffrent (more hostile) worlds where you can sometimes do a small puzzle or a race for example.

You can get treasure, items, coins, loot and grades on how well you did - but NONE of that seems rewarding enough to turn the satisfaction of getting such things into In a sense, there is no penalty for losing in this game, you get to keep the rewards from floor grades anyway.

The game isn't one, sure there are simalarities, however sence there are in truth no bosses of the overworld to Minecraft (save for the use of mods), this is a game that has bosses that one must beat in order to progress through the game. The first one is just a nusence and not tough at all The Eye of Cuthulu, equaly during the Slime rain (requirments I think are Heath at 160, and you have blue and green slime banners) Slime King. EoC (Requires 200 heath and at least 3 npc's) I feel is best to at least have Iron/Lead armor before taking him on. The Destroyer of Worlds/Brain of Cuthulu I suggjest Silver/Tungston armor, this boss requisres you to destroy Shadow Orbs/Crimson Orbs 3 times to awaken. Just make sure you are ready to face it. One is a gigantic worm like creature and roughly you need a wepon to stirke multiple times. The other is you guessed it A giganitic brain that flys around shooting out fleash colored blobs. Each are around 8000-16000 health again not very though. This is just an example of what you are looking at while playing this game and these are just the first 2 bosses that one faces in the game. I think there are 3 more bosses in normal mode and 15 in hard mode (not to be confuzed with expert mode). Is it worth getting I'd have to Yes\",\n",

I really liked Classic and Modern Sonic as characters in this game and Time Eater was interesting before we saw the obvious reveal that the 'The Time Eater' was controlled by Eggman and the Robotnik. GAMEPLAY I must This is maybe the most fun I've had with a Sonic Game. I think the control is near perfect, the level design is interesting and not 'tunnel like'. It's a saferide that will give you a lot of pleasure if you are a Classic Veteran or a Modern Veteran(I can't say this for I started out with the Adventure But I still get enjoyment out of Modern and Classic Sonic) But I still think(For me atleast) Modern Sonic was more enjoyable, with all the speedrunning tricks and that speed. Sega got fast with this GRAPHICS 9/10 Graphics look really good. It looks better than Colors and is somewhere on the same level with Sonic Lost World. But it's still not as beatiful as Unleashed. But you can add Unleashed Graphics thanks to the Modding Community. MUSIC 10/10 This is a soundtrack I really enjoyed. All of the tracks were enjoyable and nostalgic giving it that Anniversary feel. My favourite tracks are Sky Sanctuary(all of them), Crisis City(Act 1) and City Escape. I also really enjoy Speed Highway Act 1. That track just sounds like it should be played in a Night Club and I love it :3 REPLAYABILITY 10/10 When the game is pretty fun to replay and I must say, one of the best thing about this game is the Modding Community. They work on outstanding mods and they do come out freaquently. So it's a perfect way to come back to the game and try out some awesome modifications people came up OVERALL SCORE: I really liked this game. But I wanted more from the Perfect Chaos Awesome\"],\n",

       "    \"Sonic Generations Review by nikfan PLOT 6/10 I liked the plot of this But it was really short and was not going anywhere! I really liked Classic and Modern Sonic as characters in this game and Time Eater was interesting before we saw the obvious reveal that the 'The Time Eater' was controlled by Eggman and the Robotnik. GAMEPLAY I must This is maybe the most fun I've had with a Sonic Game. I think the control is near perfect, the level design is interesting and not 'tunnel like'. It's a saferide that will give you a lot of pleasure if you are a Classic Veteran or a Modern Veteran(I can't say this for I started out with the Adventure But I still get enjoyment out of Modern and Classic Sonic) But I still think(For me atleast) Modern Sonic was more enjoyable, with all the speedrunning tricks and that speed. Sega got fast with this GRAPHICS 9/10 Graphics look really good. It looks better than Colors and is somewhere on the same level with Sonic Lost World. But it's still not as beatiful as Unleashed. But you can add Unleashed Graphics thanks to the Modding Community. MUSIC 10/10 This is a soundtrack I really enjoyed. All of the tracks were enjoyable and nostalgic giving it that Anniversary feel. My favourite tracks are Sky Sanctuary(all of them), Crisis City(Act 1) and City Escape. I also really enjoy Speed Highway Act 1. That track just sounds like it should be played in a Night Club and I love it :3 REPLAYABILITY 10/10 When the game is pretty fun to replay and I must say, one of the best thing about this game is the Modding Community. They work on outstanding mods and they do come out freaquently. So it's a perfect way to come back to the game and try out some awesome modifications people came up OVERALL SCORE: I really liked this game. But I wanted more from the Perfect Chaos Awesome\"],\n",

       "    \"This is my review of the Evolve Alpha. Kraken OP. Thats it. Seriously though once i unlocked the kraken every game (played about 20+ with the kraken alone) became a 1 sided slaughter, which would make the goliath cry in a corner in shame. The kraken is so over powered you can even take on the hunters as they land without eating anything. I tested this a couple times to see if it was possible with, no armor from eating, just 2 points in lightning strike, 1 in vortex, easy. Its too mobile in the air, its too touph and its abilities do so much damage. I can't imagein it was very fun for the enemy team to get killed within the first minute of the game after the 50+ menu screens and load bars. Its like a million times better then the goliath and there is no reason to go back to the goliath once you unlock the kraken, unless you really like the play style. Goliath is balanced for the most part, Kraken is not. The game shows great promise though, they just need to do some more balanceing changes, reduce the amount of loading and menu screens etc. I didn't count it but i think the game goes through like 4/5 menus and load screens from clicking play on the main menu to getting in the game. I hope there is more to do then the standard 4v1 in 3 maps. Adding more hunters and monsters isn't enough, this game needs more modes and things to do other then VS mode. What made left 4 dead interesting for so long, was because of the long levels and varied play, with some small story elements. This has none of that. Typical games last less then 10 minutes, so there is alot of repetition and alot of running around a map looking for a monster or running away (unless your the Kraken). I will definatly play it at launch and open beta. I just hope there is more to the game by then and not just more hunters and monsters, or the game won't keep peoples interest for long.\"],\n",
