... r 1600 Hours - i really love the story, the characters and what it represents - but the state of the gam
... e is beyond awful: 1. Server issues: it struggles to let me have consistent frames and ping, there are c
... onstant server issues that prevent me from getting used to any state of my game. I dont have the best se
... tup but even with all low settings the game refuses to let me enjoy it. Saving up for a good PC is an op
... tion, but a game like Apex should aim for accessibility for all types of users. 2. No audio issue: its b
... een so bad lately that a pathfinder can zip up on me from behind without me noticing until i get shot fo
... r the first time. That happens while i have my audio so high it blasts my ears that i cant hear anyone s
... peak. I set music all low, voicelines all low, but ingame sounds all high - no sound from the zips, jump
... s or even landing- if i heal myself im basically deaf ingame. It makes it unfair and not fun. This issue
...  has been going on and getting worse since a few seasons. 3. Prices: Those are incredibly expensive and 
... not worth it. Reskins are nice but not for half your salary. Paying over 130 Euro for a special event is
...  insane. I wish ingame crafting material or the Legend Tokens could be used more. 4. Matchmaking: I feel
...  like it is not at all functioning. I either am in lobbies that are full of recognizeable movement-playe
... rs or insane content creators (in which i die incredibly fast) OR i dominate the lobbies with 13 kills -
...  none of that is good or balanced, because i am not a good player, i dont belong in either those lobbies
... . I would like to be put in at least similar skilled levels so i get the chance to fight fights and gain
...  actual experience, and improve myself. Getting anyone in your lobby that isnt the literal same skill le
... vel skews the matchmaking even more to the point nobody is enjoying it. 5. Ranked: Current Ranked System
...  is incredibly exhausting. I watch Preds play ranked that are either full of cheaters or hackers, and no
... thing seems to happen to improve the situation. Why have easy anticheat (which prevents linux users from
...  playing the game) if it doesnt even prevent cheating. On top the way i see others play ranked completel
... y draws me off playing it - ratting til theres only 10 teams left is not something that should be meta. 
... 6. Broken characters: At the moment Catalyst, Horizon and Bangalore are the meta for ALGs, or Ranked bec
... ause those characters are incredibly broken. I main Revenant and Ash, and even reborn revenant with the 
... intense powerful ult doesnt reach to that meta. Horizon is incredibly unfun to play against. 7. Overall 
... quality: The quality of the game got worse considering matchmaking, bugs, events and security. I want th
... is game to be successful and fun, and i want to spend more time in it, because i met a lot of amazing pe
... ople through ingame apex and on streams. Its an important part of my hobbies and something i never thoug
... ht id be working hard on to improve myself in. Apex is my first ever FPS and will always stay special, b
... ut the way it is going right now i feel like i am losing my love for it. I play on a gaming-Laptop from 
... 2019, started in Season 7 and use Mouse and Keyboard. I never used a controller. I will change this revi
... ew if theres genuine change in the game that i am happy with. Dont let apex turn into a quick reskin-cas
... hgrab before it dies and listen to the community. I know there are many voices that say horrible things 
... or threaten devs which makes it harder for the genuine caring voices to be heard. I want to hear other p
... eoples experience on this game and their recommendations on what could be better. Stay kind and happy ho
... lidays! Carni 24/12/2023'''

... spend most of Palworld wondering how Pocketpair has got away with it all. Palworld is a patchwork of bor

... ot going to die of starvation very quickly, but it can happen and like most survival games there’s very 
... little in the way of specific goals or story. That means your first priority is to build a base, as both
...  a defensible position and somewhere where you can craft food, weapons, health, armour, and all the othe
... r video game necessities. Collecting ‘Pals’ is important but it’s not the be all and end all of the game
... . There are many human enemies wandering around, from poachers and pro-Pal extremists to the central evi
... l gang, but all of them have the same response to your presence: to try and shoot you dead with high cal
... ibre weapons. After first shooting them, or bludgeoning them into unconsciousness, Pals are caught with 
... a ‘pal sphere’, but rather than this leading to a lot of quaint turn-based battle you instead use captur
... ed Pals as allies in third person battles that look like The Division transposed into a cartoonish Pokém
... on style world. Many Pals can wield weapons themselves, while others are weapons, which you can either l
... eave to do their thing or pick up and wield as a flamethrower or lightning gun. Whatever else you say ab
... out Palworld – and it is a very difficult game to appraise – it barely has a single new idea of its own,
...  borrowing liberally from Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, Monster Hunter, Minecraft, and many others. It does
... n’t copy mindlessly though and while its third person combat is generic it’s reasonably competent. Likew
... ise, the dungeon designs are bland and unexciting but they are enlivened by some fun boss battles. The c
... losest it gets to originality is what happens when you bring Pals back to your base, which is where thin
... gs get really weird. Pals don’t evolve but you can breed them, with most being immediately press-ganged 
... into servitude, helping to build new structures and crafting regularly needed items so that you don’t ha
... ve to – while also tending to crops and doing all the other boring jobs around the base. In gameplay ter
... ms that’s perfectly reasonable, as you try not to overwork them and the base-building becomes an impress
... ively complex management sim. But the way it’s portrayed on-screen can be genuinely disturbing, the most
...  obvious example being when you tell a Pal to craft a knife to then use on his fellow slaves to turn the
... m into your food. If the game was intended as a parody, then that would have worked great – the ethics o
... f actual Pokémon have always been questionable – but while there are some attempts at edgy humour, and s
... omething may have been lost in translation, the game never pushes the idea that it’s a satire. You can t
... reat it that way but that’s largely on you. Breeding edible slaves is not the only morally questionable 
... aspect to the game, with social media alive with talk of whether Pocketpair has used AI image generation
...  to create the Pal designs, by training them on actual pokémon. One of Pocketpair’s previous games was b
... ased entirely around creating AI imagery, and a lot of the Pal designs either look almost identical to r
... eal pokémon or appear to be made up of disparate body parts from multiple critters. Ironically, the AI i
... tself is terrible, with Pals and human enemies frequently being confused about what they’re doing or get
... ting stuck in scenery. The visuals might look better than Scarlet and Violet but in its own way Palworld
...  is just as broken, with numerous collision detection issues and missing animations. The user interface 
... is also terrible but the big difference with Palworld is that it has the excuse of currently being early
...  access – and not being part of one of the biggest media franchises in the world. Or at least not yet an
... yway. Believe it or not, Palworld is one of only six games to have ever had more than 1 million people p
... laying it at once on Steam and it sold four million copies in less than three days. That’s sold, not pla
... yed – so the fact that it’s on Game Pass doesn’t come close to explaining its success. And this is while
...  it’s only got co-op options, with no competitive play between humans, so there’s every chance that succ
... ess is only going to build from here. Or perhaps it’ll be another online flash in the pan. Or The Pokémo
... n Company will sue them into oblivion. To be honest it’s future is very hard to guess at. Palworld’s suc
... cess is built upon the shoulders of giants but there’s no denying it is a fun experience, although how m
... uch of that is due to the novelty of it all is hard to say at this early stage. We feel almost guilty fo

Here are 7 aspects of the game Palworld, along with their descriptions:

1. Gameplay - Survival game with third-person shooter elements, part clone of Pokémon with Pals (edible slaves) instead of Pokémon.
2. Morally questionable aspects - Use of AI image generation to create Pal designs, breeding edible slaves, and disturbing way in which Pals are treated.
3. Visuals - Better than Scarlet and Violet, but with numerous collision detection issues and missing animations.
4. User Interface - Terrible.
5. Co-op options - Only co-op options available, with no competitive play between humans.
6. Success - One of only six games to have ever had more than 1 million people playing it at once on Steam, sold four million copies in less than three days, and has the potential for 
important ramifications for both AI content generation and the Pokémon franchise as a whole.
7. Fun experience - Despite copy/paste approach to game and creature design, and disturbing way in which Pals are treated, it hangs together as a fun multiplayer game at least in the short 
term.

In summary, Palworld is an early access game that has gained significant attention and popularity despite its questionable ethics and blatant copying of other games and franchises. While it 
has some fun multiplayer elements and a complex management sim aspect to its base-building, the game's use of AI-generated images and the treatment of in-game "Pals" have raised concerns 
about its originality and morality. The game's success is a mystery, but it has sold millions of copies in a short time frame and has important implications for the future of AI content 
generation and the Pokémon franchise as a whole.

In this review, the author provides their opinion on Palworld, an early access game that has gained significant attention due to its similarities to the popular Pokémon franchise. The 
reviewer notes that while the game borrows heavily from various other games and franchises, it is still a fun multiplayer experience despite some questionable design choices. They highlight 
the novelty of the game's concept and the disturbing treatment of the in-game "Pals," who are essentially enslaved and used^C

...  Pals and human enemies frequently being confused about what they’re doing or getting stuck in scenery. The visuals might look better than Scarlet and Violet but in its own way Palworld is just

... han 1 million people playing it at once on Steam and it sold four million copies in less than three days. That’s sold, not played – so the fact that it’s on Game Pass doesn’t come close to expl

Here are seven summaries for each aspect of Palworld, presented in JSON format:

{ASPECT: 'Gameplay', SUMMARY: "Palworld is a survival game with third-person combat, where players must build a base, craft items, and fight off human enemies. The game has a patchwork of 
borrowed ideas from various games, but it doesn't have any new ideas of its own. The gameplay is reasonably competent, but the dungeon designs are bland and unexciting. The closest the game 
gets to originality is in its base-building aspect, where players must manage their Pals' workload and resources." }

{ASPECT: 'Audio', SUMMARY: "The audio in Palworld is average, with forgettable music and voice acting. The sound effects are passable but unremarkable." }

{ASPECT: 'Graphics', SUMMARY: "Palworld has visually impressive graphics, with detailed character designs and environments. However, there are some collision detection issues and missing 
animations that detract from the overall experience." }

{ASPECT: 'Community', SUMMARY: "Palworld has a thriving community, with over 1 million concurrent players on Steam. The game's success is built upon the shoulders of giants, but it's hard to 
say how long it will last. There are discussions about whether Pocketpair has used AI image generation to create the Pal designs, which could have implications for the Pokémon franchise as a 
whole." }

{ASPECT: 'Performance', SUMMARY: "Palworld is currently in early access and has some performance issues. The game can be glitchy and laggy at times, but it's hard to say how these issues will
be addressed in the future." }

{ASPECT: 'Morality', SUMMARY: "Palworld raises questions about morality, particularly in its treatment of Pals. Some players have expressed concerns about the ethics of creating edible 
slaves, while others see it as a fun multiplayer experience. The game's success may have implications for the Pokémon franchise and AI content generation." }

{ASPECT: 'Success', SUMMARY: "Palworld has been one of the most successful indie launches of all time, with over 4 million copies sold in less than three days. Its success may have important 
ramifications for both AI content generation and the Pokémon franchise as a whole." }

{ASPECT: 'Future', SUMMARY: "It's hard to predict the future of Palworld, but its success so far has been impressive. The game's novelty may wear off over time, but it could have important 
implications for the Pokémon franchise and AI content generation." }

... nt DLC made the technical problems worse rather than better sums up the terrible position developer Game Freak is currently in, as it’s forced to make new games too quickly, with too few staff.
...  We don’t know how many people work at Japanese indie developer Pocketpair but even though Palworld is currently only in early access it looks far better than any official Pokémon game ever has
... . That said, this isn’t a straight clone, in the style of games like Cassette Beasts and Temtem, It’s something far, far stranger than that. There’s a lot for The Pokémon Company and their deve
... lopers to learn from Palworld but at the same time this is a flawed and at times disquieting game, not just in terms of its content but how much it borrows from other titles and how much it see
... ms to rely on AI taking from human artists and creators. Since there are so few high profile examples, we’re assuming it’s very difficult to sue anyone because in-game characters, locations or 
... concepts look too similar to an existing property. Nevertheless, if you’ve played any recent Pokémon game, you’ll spend most of Palworld wondering how Pocketpair has got away with it all. Palwo
... rld is a patchwork of borrowed ideas and features, from a wide range of different games, but in terms of gameplay the most important influence is not Pokémon. Instead, it’s survival games like
