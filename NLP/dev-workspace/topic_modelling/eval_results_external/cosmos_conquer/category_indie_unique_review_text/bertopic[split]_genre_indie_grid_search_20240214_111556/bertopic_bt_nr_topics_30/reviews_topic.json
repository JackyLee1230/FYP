    "review": "the concept is absolutely amazing. the pacing isn ' t quite accurate, for example i was able to get off of earth in 1900 and went medieval in about 2000 bc. there is nothing different between each civilization type so it feels repetitive. also sometimes i ' m just unable to build anything and the yields all say \"??? \" and the game doesn ' t explain why. with all that said it ' s not abandoned by the developer though, which is a plus, and i am excited to see how it will improve. i ' d say wait until it ' s out of early access to buy it since it ' s clearly unfinished but has plenty of potential."
