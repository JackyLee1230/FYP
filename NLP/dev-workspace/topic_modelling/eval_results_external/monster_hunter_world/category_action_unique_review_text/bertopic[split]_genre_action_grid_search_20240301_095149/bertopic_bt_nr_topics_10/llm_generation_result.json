          "monster hunter world is a genuine blast to play. the mechanics are easy to get into at least at first and the feeling of reward and accomplishment you feel after bringing down a monster, slicing off the bit you needed, and crafting that weapon or armor you wanted is great. the creature variety is good and even creatures that are just variations on another are still fun to fight. the world feels alive and vibrant and the chaos of another monster intruding on a hunt and brawling with both you and your target is a fun healthy dose of chaos that keeps things interesting even if you are just farming something you have already killed. the game offers a great variety of weapons to try and i often found myself running around collecting bits for a bunch of new weapons just to see how they feel. its certainly worth trying all of is a bit grindy at times, so be prepared to repeat fights for different weapons and armor. aside from that the main negative i found was the story was really weak. so don ' t go into monster hunter world looking for a great rpg story. its just a very basic motivation to nudge you along as you hunt monsters for gear. its basically a gear treadmill with giant monster fights. but it does it very just for context i tried da"

          "changing my review to \" recommended \" as i was able to get the game to work. after exhausting all of my options, from rolling back video drivers to, not only reformatting my pc, but even trying a different distribution of windows 10, i tried one more simple thing. installing msi afterburner and setting the power limit from 100 % ( default ) to 120 % ( max ). apparently my 1080ti ' s stock clock was unstable when playing this game and maybe ffxv ( haven ' t confirmed if my ffxv crashes are resolved with this ). if you want to read my old review it ' s below, but tl ; dr, i said the game was great but broken. now it ' s just great. haven ' t had any more connection issues review : i really didn ' t want to write a negative review, but after waiting 2 weeks for a patch, not only did the patch not completely fix the connection issues, they didn ' t even mention the crashing issues i and at least a handful of others have. i really want to play the game but it ' s hard to get motivated when you ' re not sure if you ' ll crash before you even finish the quest you ' re working on ;",
