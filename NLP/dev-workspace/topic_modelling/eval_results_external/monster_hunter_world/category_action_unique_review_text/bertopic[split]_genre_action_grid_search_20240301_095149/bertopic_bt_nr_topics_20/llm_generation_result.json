( note that his hitboxes are still extremely poorly done in some small cases, a minor complaint i ' ve had with the game and the series as a whole since i started the bad : - terrible meta due to insanely overpowered, terrible balancing / power creep for two armor sets : 1 : defender, a low rank and high rank armor set. there ' s also defender weapons that are just flat out better than anything else at that tier, and are both available at the start to those who purchase iceborne, allowing those users to get",
          "while the game looks great and will initially seem fun, if you don ' t have players to actually play with it ' s terrible. then there is the added defender weapons and the guardian armor meant to be used by new players to blitz the game ' s original content to get to the expansion content. these do make it easier, they ruin the experience of trying to learn the monsters and actually do what the intended way to play the game if you have friends that want to help, they can ' t join you on story missions until you get through the initial cut scene where the new monster you are hunting for the quest completes. then you ' re supposed to put up an sos flare to get them to come help and while you do that, the monster is hitting your and eating you. this game seriously needs others to play with you if you aren ' t going to use the op weapons and armor given to play on easy mode for the beginning, yet getting other to play with is a pain and clunky. why can ' t we start fresh character and complete the story together at the same time i don ' t know. why others can ' t join you because you need to watch a cut scene first i don ' t know. thought this would be fun"

          ", especially tempered ones, but killing them doesn ' t take as long if you are good at avoiding getting hit. is that really a bad thing? 2. it ' s too easy. - tempered monsters are almost exactly on the same level damage - wise as g - rank difficulty in mh3u or mh4u. i don ' t really understand these complaints. 3. there aren ' t enough monsters. - there are less than usual, i do agree with that. although there are a plethora of great monsters, a bit more variance could have improved it even more. however - i think what is there, is going to be sufficient and enjoyable even for series veterans. especially alongside the much more enjoyable free roaming expeditions and the fun of looking for secrets and interesting things within each area in the there ' s no g - rank - just because there isn ' t a g - rank \" in name \" doesn ' t mean there aren ' t g - rank level challenges all over the place in the game. tempered monsters seemed to me like a very similar challenge to g - rank monsters in previous games. and honestly, i don ' t understand why people like the idea of \" restarting from the beginning but slightly harder \" a third time.",
          "monster hunter has never been this accessible, and i love it. as a long time player of the series ( started with portable 3rd ), it ' s amazing to see all of the core aspects of mh maintained in this new and revamped package that takes heavy inspiration from the combat systems of gu and 4u and expands them with even better mobility and responsiveness. new players can expect to find a very welcoming experience that starts very easy, but ramps up in difficulty towards the end - game. as for iceborne, the difficulty curves up 90\u00b0, monsters will demand better tactics and more preparation, making for some of the absolute best fights in the 5th generation. graphically, the game is stunning and filled with detail, the soundtrack has many remastered themes from previous titles, as well as many new ones, and all of them are incredible to listen to, and the customization options the new skill system brings will surely have you making sets and sets of armor and when you start up the game, you are given a set of armor and weapons called guardian / defender respectively. do not use these if you ' ve never played the game before, since they ' re meant to get you quickly to the dlc and completely break the base worldborne gets an easy"

          "alright, i played this game for 200 hours, i should probs make a in general is great, but you need, need to know a couple things : 1 - mh as a beginner is frustrating, as learning how to fight each monster in the game is difficult and punishing, especially later on. be prepared to fight monsters many a time just to kill them once, unless you get carried in multiplayer, but even then, when you dont die enough to fail the mission for the team - 2 - you are going to be killing monsters likely a few to alot of times to make their respective armor sets / weapons to have better gear for future monsters. this can be eased by the guardian armor set which is easy to upgrade and use all the way to the end of the base game, but was designed for people rushing the base game to iceborne, and drops off there. and even then, it might not carry you at times with resistances and stuff ( its been awhile since base game for me, but in the endgame, yeah, your going to be making armor quite a bit unless a armor set just clicks and has everything you need ( which is rare ) and still will be eventually replaced at some point until the game is fully complete"

          "oh man where do i begin with this hunter has been a long going series and because of this game it ' s been becoming very popular and i love started play this series back with 4u on the 3ds and i have loved it so much. i will say this. mhw is imo the easiest and kindest mh game for new players to hop weapon is different so if you don ' t like one try another one. i will say. the hardest part about playing on pc is the gap we have with console players. but with iceborne coming out we are currently caught until iceborne actually releases. console gets it next month and pc gets it in january. this happened with the base game when it came out so we kinda use to it back to fun stuff. armor ' s in this game look amazing. the monster that returned look so good. the new monsters are just as cool as the original ones from older games. combat in this game is the best. you aren ' t fighting the controls like you kinda did in the old one gripe with this game. and if you ' ve played other mh games you know what i ' m talking about. the weapons look certain ones look amazing but a good bit of them are just the",
          "bad the hitboxes that was intentional game design to make the monsters harder, but that shouldn ' t be the way to increase difficulty, it once again, does not feel good to play against and makes the game less is a perfect example of how the hitboxes should ' ve been, for all weapon variety a lot of people complained that most weapons didn ' t look unique personally thought that was a silly complain when the real issue is that in the endgame there are only like 1 - 6 viable weapon options depending on your target and the weapon you example, if you play longsword anything but the fatalis blade is unviable and there is no reason to take anything else unless the target monster is weak to blast, then you have another i ' m trying to say is that most elemental weapons suck really hard and they should ' ve made them quite a bit stronger. they either have extremely bad sharpness combined with extremely bad raw or so little elemental damage that you might as well the one that deals almost 20 % more raw ranged weapons deal more damage than melee so the safe options deals more damage, aight got it. * cough * sticky ammo * cough * people new to the series probably shouldn ' t read too much into these cons,"

          "i have played most of the mh games and i have to say, they really improved the formula in this one. this game has some really good changes that take a lot of the pointless garbage out of it. there ' s still tons of different play styles based on the wide variety of weapons and armor, so it never really feels stale or old. it ' s also very easy to get help with harder monsters, which is a huge plus. you still really have to wear gear that has strengths / resisitances based on the monster you ' re going after. i like this because it actually makes you think, not just mindless only thing i wish they would do is make armor a bit more customizable appearance wise. you have to mix and match a lot and can end up looking really goofy. that ' s really the only issue i have with the game, other than that minor issue it ' s really solid. i would definitely recommend this game to long time mh players, or brand new players.",
          "of optional and special quests stuff including stuff like raid boss monsters intended to be tackled by a full team of 4 hunters and arena quests with premade loadouts. there is a decent amount of grind in this game and it is somewhat core to the gameplay although it is far more generous and less time consuming than other grindy games i have played, it is entirely possible to get the best possible endgame loadout setup for multiple weapons within 300 hrs of play from new game. there is no player class or level - up system in this game, your character remains the same at end - game as you were at start, instead what changes is the weapons and armor you use, along with the item and tool loadout you carry + the skills you developed. all armor pieces in this game have skills associated with them that can have a multitude of effects which can be further customised with slot - in items. you hunt and maybe farm strong monsters, then you ' ll use their parts to craft weapons and armor from that same monster to prep for the hunt of the next stronger monster. monsters can inflict a variety of statuses and ailments and have innate weaknesses and resistances to different elemental types you can attack them with, preparation for each hunt can"
