          "having clocked in over 400 hours into the base game, there are glaring issues with some things in this expansion to mhw. some of the things i ' ve noticed with this expansion are less than savory for the game as a whole and call into question some design choices made. firstly, the clutch claw feels way too mandatory for normal play in master rank. since wounding monsters with the claw is now required to deal efficient damage to some breakable or severable parts, you will have to repeat this process likely several times for one monster, especially for specific part breaks like tail cuts. also, light weapons have to do it to one part twice in a row to have the same effect as a heavy weapon, which is stupid and unfair to people who play with such weapons. second, items like flash pods were nerfed way too hard. many monsters seem to now ignore flashes unless they are exactly in front of their face and even when flashed they seem to still have mostly normal fighting capability. third, a lot of monsters are such bullet sponges now that it calls into question if master rank is just a more forced version of the tempered and arch - tempered system. look, i don ' t mind the monsters being a little tankier and a"

          "from what i ' ve played so far, i love the expansion. problem is the tech issues. i went from smooth framerates and decent cpu usage to nearly half the frames and high cpu usage with lots of heat coming out of my computer. for context, i ' ve just beaten glavenus and nargacuga ; i want to play more, but i don ' t want to risk my computer right i ' ve noticed the weasel - words \" should lower cpu usage during active gameplay \" in the latest patch supposedly to help with performance ; while my usage dropped about 3 % on average and my cpu temperature never went above 73c, i notice the patch notes said nothing about actually removing the checker bloatware causing the cpu and performance issues. i still experience an average 20fps less than i used to, as well as stuttering and freezing of the game for short times, both things i never used to experience before with base mhw. until this is fixed, my review remains negative and i cannot recommend this in its current state."
