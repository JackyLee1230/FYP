          "this is the worst game i have ever played on steam. this is game is not optimized for anything. if this game had dlss support it would be better. it stutters and audio cuts out. i can ' t speak for people have higher graphics cards and better intel or amd chips. i have 32 gigs of ram for higher frame rates and it doesn ' t help this game needs a massive overhaul. i installed it on a hdd my mistake on that but the overall game play stutters, freezes, audio cuts out and buildings don ' t load in. the game doesn ' t hold 60 fps and it barely holds at 40 fps. the only thing that ran good was the first ship battle but at 50 fps. i would say wait till they do a massive update cuz right now i ' m putting my money towards a better gameplay experience. i ' m glad i didn ' t buy the premium edition because i would have been are : nvidia geforce rtx 3060 intel i7 - 10700kf 32gb ram"

          "poorly optimized, runs between 25 - 35 fps on both low and ultra settings. you ' d think that if ultra was 30 - 35 then low should be 60, but no. even with max settings game still looked odd after disabling up - scaling. a $ 70 title should run at 50 - 60 fps on the lowest settings minimum. and trying to optimize the settings to get better frames i have dumped to many hours into it to get a refund. so here i will sit and wait till they fix the performance.",
          "if you dont have a top of the line graphics card then dont bother and then even then youre gonna have a lot of crashes, for some weird reason the game gums up with all the loading screens, it litteraly breaks the game and you will crash. ive never seen a game where it revolves around loading screens manages to carry over the other area you left and nail your graphics. it then just slowly builds up and gets slower till you crash. bad graphics card you got about 1 maybe 2 loading screens and you will crash, mid card is about 2 - 5 loading screens and then crash and good to great cards are once every 20ish loading screens then crash, you go down either way and the only way to solve this is to just save and close the game then re open and play till you load in again and the screen is suddenly very bright white, then you save and leave and load back in, that is so far the only fix to a game that is very underwhelming and of course in modern gaming fashion not working either. i want to like the game but so far its just decent then it crashes, i do give the game credit its fast to load back up and the game saves pretty much to the point where you get"

          "i ' m escaping to the one place that hasn ' t been corrupted by shpace! fallout in space. if you like that one you will like this one, if you don ' t mind the bad performance that is. but in a quick summary i do not recommend the game right now with the bad performance it ' s having, even though the gameplay, story and characters are fun, the bad performance can really ruin it. will update as patches are released and as i progress in the performance [ / h1 ] performance is bad as usual with most aaa games now. running on a 3080ti r5 5600x 32gb ddr4 in 2k, it ' s mostly bad in the big cities goes from 30 to 60 fps with a mix of high to ultra, going medium to high makes no difference from what i have noticed. bad performance on lush planets just like the cities, works great on low detailed planets or closed off areas, it ' s always above 60 fps then. [ h1 ] menus [ / h1 ] it ' s obvious the menu was made for a console in mind, it feels super cluttered and slow until you eventually get it in your system on how it all works then it ' s okay,",
          "pros : no game breaking bugs like in their previous games, some side quest lines are better and longer than the main quests, gun play is really good compared to their previous game franchise game is really fun and enjoyable, i really recommend getting it and ignore it ' s visual bugs, some bugs ( their funny so i let them slide ), audio bugs, optimization is really bad, no texture setting in graphic settings, guns aren ' t accurate to their sights all the time ( just gonna say for the guns purpose maybe it ' s due to how shittily the guns were made by their manufactures like a sten vs an m4 ) fsr3 causes ghosting, not really any difference in graphics from low - 30 - 40 ( i drop to 20 - 30 avg in new atlantis ) pc specs : gpu : 6gb gtx - 1660 cpu : i7 - 4770 ( 2013 ) ram : 16gb ddr3 settings render res : 67 % with auto adjust to environment preset : low frs3 : enabled, sharpening max ( causes ghosting ) even with those settings i only drop maybe 10 or less fps on ultra. game is playable at 40fps but i heard from multiple people with high end specs"
