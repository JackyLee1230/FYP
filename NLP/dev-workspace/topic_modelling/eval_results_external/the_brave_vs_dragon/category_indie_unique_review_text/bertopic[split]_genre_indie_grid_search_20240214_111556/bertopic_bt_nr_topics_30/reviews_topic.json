    "review": "localization is horrible, the game is a grindfest without any sort of build importance, just slap whatever you want to play with and it will work at some point due to power low amount of content, game time gets ramped up by the astronomically low drop rates and unsatisfyingly low number build mechanisms fail once your characters beat 1 or 2 levels, since there ' s no \" replay level \" option, it ' s always \" play next level \" and if you want to replay earlier instances of the level you need to reset the whole level, which not this is a no from me"
