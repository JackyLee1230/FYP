    "review": "better than i expected, but about right for the has 5 towers, tank, st dps, aoe dps, expand territory, and money seem to be unlimited with meta progression between levels. progress / grinding is required. higher level upgrades / meta progression are very significant. replaying earlier levels feels 100x easier after a few couple levels felt spamy until higher level towers are unlocked."
