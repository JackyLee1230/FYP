          "first off, the score : 9 / 10. this is a fantastic and fun game that any open world fan should play. if you dont have it yet, wait a month or so after launch for bug fixes, then get it. i only have two complaints about the game that prevent it from being a 10 / 10. first is the bugs. its quiet bad. mostly just little glitches and things like npcs walking through walls. but i have had some bugs that made missions harder to complete and one case where i had to reload because the main quest line was unprogressable due to a bug of an npc falling through the world. that said, these dont really stop the fun and will be fixed. the only complaint about the game itself is the linearity of missions. while this game has plenty of rpg mechanics, levels, skills, loot, etc, its not a true rpg where choice matters. many quests are very linear. they ask you, v, to make a decision and they let you talk about other options but in the end you have to do it \" their way \". you get very little say in how things go except in whether youd rather go in guns blazing, or stealth."
