    "review": "this is a very good retro inspired puzzler that may look simple but can get quite tricky at times. the puzzles are well designed but for some reason i struggled with the thing that you can only create diagonal ice blocks beneath you. now this mechanic may seem like the game is limiting your creativity but it is in fact the opposite. on harder levels you will have to use all your knowledge gained from easier levels and solve some really clever puzzles. over the 7 worlds / chapters you will be introduced to new things like rocks, crates and pipes. what i liked the most is that you can enter any puzzle at any time so if you are stuck you can just move on to the next puzzle. there is also a quicksave function that helps a lot on longer levels. it is not the hardest puzzler but not at all casual so there is a fair amount of challenge. the controls are fine the music is ok and the look, i don ' t care how a puzzler looks as long as it is well made so let ' s leave it at made a walkthrough so if you are stuck take a look at it. i decided to make one when i finished chapter 5 so i had to spend more time on solving puzzles for the second time and recording"

    "review": "i know the developer a bit so i am slightly biased towards recommending this game, but i bought it of my own accord and still want to give my honest review. i will point out all of the good and bad that i it ' s a really cute game in terms of the artwork, i like how it looks despite its simplicity. it actually looks much better when playing the game in comparison to the tiny video and screenshots you see in the steam store page. i thought i wouldn ' t like the artwork very much originally, but seeing the game in full screen, i was pleasantly surprised! - i ' m an avid puzzle gamer, and surprisingly this went from easy to difficult very quickly. if i didn ' t like challenges so much, this aspect could be a con, but i really enjoyed being thrust into actual puzzles and having to figure techniques out without getting a long boring introductory series of puzzles to learn the ropes. that ' s a major gripe i have with many other puzzle games cons : - i feel like the controls could be a little bit more responsive. a couple of times i found myself hitting keys too quickly and moving off a ledge or block, and since i also already hit the key to place a block as i originally intended,"

    "review": "instead i end up removing the block in front of me after the character lands, causing the whole setup to break and requiring a restart. i feel like this will only get more annoying as i get into some of the more complex later levels, however it also might end up not being an issue as i play more and get used to the the first world did take me a good 15 minutes to complete, and i know it will get harder as i go and the levels will take longer, but it does seem like there ' s not a whole lot of levels overall. if it ' s really as short as it seems, i think adding more levels would make the price a bit more worth it still gets a thumbs up from me!"
