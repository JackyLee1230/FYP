       "{-1: [\" I originally Kickstarted this one a long time ago before its second name change. What was originally known as Ravensdale is now finally released as Rogue Stormers. I didn't have that high of but perhaps too high, as I'm quite disappointed and underwhelmed by this final release. I don't care that much how it changed over development like others seem I just care about what we have now. I put in over a dozen hours, unlocked 2 extra characters, got a bunch of and I'm honestly bored with it, despite never seeing to the end of the game. This is probably as much as I'll ever play it. When you first start playing, it's impressive. The theme is clearly Warhammer, but for whatever reason, they didn't license it, even though that license is given out in backalleys at this point to anyone that wants it. Have you seen some of the Warhammer games on Steam these In any case, it's space marines and orks. It looks nice. It does have good controls, and switches between controller/keyboard on the fly, something 60$ titles like Dark Souls 3 still can't do to this day. I found the map to be quite useful in this game, which doesn't spin btw, another forgotten game design concept. You have to roam around levels repeatedly in this game, so, enjoy those nice map markers. But like every game out of Early Access or Kickstarter, it feels unfinished. It has frame rate issues everywhere, and freezes regularly in its menus. I don't know why these issues made it to release. I can't even read the 'story' pages because the game just keeps freezing on that screen. It's absurd. The randomization clearly isn't tested enough either. Enemies and items regularly spawn or clip inside walls, where they cannot be reached. The fire guy you unlock after the first marine, his own fire blocks enemy projectiles on screen, which seems stupid and I don't think it's intentional. It just seems like the game isn't polished enough or they'd have put enemy effects over player effects so you can see wtf you're doing. I think the main killer for me here though is the difficulty. The game is punishingly difficult, as if stuck in hard mode with no way to turn it down for normal Human players. In this day and age, you should not expect every player to be a grand champion of platformers, or at least have selectable difficulty modes. You only get 1 life per run, and lose everything upon death. You do get permanent perks per character, but they come off a painfully slow amount of XP per run. The perks don't do much, meaning you'll have to grind for ages stacking them up. To make this worse, the perks aren't even shared between characters, of which there are 5. If it takes so long to grind them up, why can't they just be shared then? After all the grinding, if you switch characters, you're back to being fodder. But it has Co Op! Ya, that Co Op. The Co Op, which should have been a selling point, is actually one big failure as far as I'm concerned. Cool, Co Op with up to 4 players! I can't wait! But you all share the same wait, what? Really? We're over the internet here. We should be able to roam levels freely. Wtf were they thinking with this? This ruins the entire game for Co Op, and I didn't bother to Co Op right after I realized it did this. Just terrible. I couldn't imagine trying to play through the game like this. You have to be attached at the hip to every player you're with, which is a suicidal mess, and doesn't allow the freedom you'd expect on open ended levels. The game is designed for free roaming of levels but basically doesn't allow you to do it in Co Op. You can also easily be killed by enemies off screen because the camera is stuck in the other direction. Wonderful. They really should have let everyone freely roam levels. This is not like Trine or Gauntlet, games you can actually get through with a shared screen. Here, sharing the screen is a nightmare. Have fun with that. It should have been like Borderlands, where everyone can go anywhere in each area. this is what you get for your 20$; a frustrating overly difficult buggy mess most players probably won't see the end of before giving up on. With better polish, a less punishing difficulty, and a decent Co OP, I would have highly recommended this. But as it I honestly wish I didn't Kickstart this. I'd recommend Rogue Legacy instead, which is better in practically every way.\",\n",
       "  \"Epanalepsis for me personally was a very frustrating game, from art style, to its linear nature, there were things here I just didn't click with. The game is unabashedly a whacked out story and never really explains anything at all. I would love to tell you what the story of Epanalepsis is all about but it doesn't actually give you any answers. The story flows at a rapid pace and leaves it to your interpretation to get your answers. Now I have played games that feature short stories, The Charnel House Trilogy is a prime example of simple straight forward gameplay with a cohesive story and game elements, oddly enough also published by Mastertronic. It seems like Epanalepsis goes against the grain in just about every way, when it came down to it. To sum up Epanalepsis, gameplay is rather easy. This isn't really a point and click adventure game but more a visual novel. You are essentially on rails but you determine how fast they move. Go straight to your objective in the next room or stop and examine things in the area. This is basically it from beginning to the end of the game. Occasionally a decision is given to you that may or may not affect the ending. Lack of interactivity also felt frustrating to me, you feel like your just moving from text box to text box. The game doesn't actually give you much to play around with other then a few moments of 'Go find this I felt that the game could've added a bit more for the player to do other than just slide around. When I finished Epanalepsis, I didn't have a sense of wonder or thoughtful inquiry, I was more shocked that it was just over and that was it. There is nothing wrong with a short story but it felt like Epanalepsis wasn't interested in me as a player. The tone and narrative on the other hand are done well. You really get a feeling for the three main characters who are stretched out over a wide space of time. From 1990s to the year 2030, each section/chapter of the game creates a unique feel and tone to the game. I wanted to know more about these times and characters but felt rushed and moved along, for the sake of mystery and vagueness. What ties the three time periods together are these supernatural characters who more or less say 'Your decisions matter, but not really, because you have made them a hundred This sentiment is driven into your head several times. For a game that is exclusively based off its story and themes, your connection to the characters is only represented in the every day objects of their abodes. From the 90's mixtapes to the online gaming of 2000s. Sadly, you're not really encouraged to look at these items littered about the environments. This adds much needed time to the game but isn't required for you to complete the game. You have to approach this game with a sense of investigation that is solely driven by you. The game will never encourage you to stop and smell the roses. There is no bonus or secret hidden anywhere, you simply just get to know more about that character in that time period. Then your ripped away to another main character and restart the process. By the time you get to the end, your exhausted by the fragmented nature of the game. Moving on and breaking down the other elements of Epanalepsis, the price of the game is subjective. The truth is that you can beat this game within an hour, if you're looking for a game that offers replayability and length, the game is going to come up lacking. You are playing this game because you are interested in its story and message, whatever that may be personally to you. There is also additional DLC for you to purchase and enjoy. The well done soundtrack is available for purchase, as well as The Epanalepsis Papers. A collection of scans of the developers notebooks and essays/annotations on development of the game. These may give you further insight into the games story. The soundtrack is something that I found to be done quite well, each track is played effectively according to the story. The tracks do repeat but never annoyingly. The music does a good job of making you feel like everything is normal but that there is still something amiss. Then the music shifts to an outlandish track and everything is suddenly trippy. This I liked quite a bit and wouldn't of minded more of in other areas of the game. Sound effects from moving, to walking through doors were there but nothing else that really caught my attention. The art style is where I was also thrown off quite a bit. Perhaps its a personal preference but it never really spoke to me. The characters themselves moved oddly and looked strange sometimes, depending upon the environments they found themselves within. While there is detail in the different abodes of the characters, you can't help but shake the feeling that the game feels like it was made on Windows Paint. There are times where the game looks ornate but other times where it feels very uninspiring to look at. Again that is up to personal preference. There are some technical aspects to the game worth mentioning as well. There is a slight bug where the camera isn't oriented with the text box. You have to shift your character to see what is being described/spoken. The game doesn't have any resolution controls or options whatsoever. Other simple features like being able to move quickly through a room is painstakingly slow. Your characters walk very slowly. You can't double click on an exit but must physically walk your character to the door or to the object you wish to interact with. This is fine for things such as doors and small objects but even larger objects require that you approach them to get a description. This feels slightly silly at times and could've been made a bit more convenient for the player. Speeding up the protagonist a slight bit would've fixed most of these issues. The game does have quite the following, many people have mentioned they felt a connection and deeply impacted by the tones and characters of the game. I personally didn't feel that way but you may find yourself enthralled with its storytelling. What it boils down to for me was that there was no satisfying answers. You just have to accept the game for what it is. If you can't do that you may find yourself as frustrated as I was. One thing that can be said about Epanalepsis is that it is unique, I haven't seen many games quite like it or dared to tell such a strange story for better or worse. It doesn't really try to innovate the wheel or add any interesting gameplay dynamics. What it does try to do is make you think about yourself and where you are. So with that in mind, if you feel like you can connect with this game and perhaps don't mind games that are open to interpretation, you enjoy weird stories, and don't demand answers, you may enjoy this game. Sadly for me, it just didn't click.\",\n",
       "  \" -EXqcsSoA Spirits of Xanadu it's not what I expected. It caught me completely off guard. It's weird, but in a good way. A way that I like. At first glance it looks like a low polygon sci-fi generci shooter, but believe me it's more than that. It's hard to talk about the game and not spoil anything. I'll try my best to avoid spoilers. There descent amount of video options here – resolution, fullscreen, V-sync, shadows, film grain, FXAA, SSAO, depth of field, bloom and motion blur. For some odd reason when everything is on high, my framerate drops to 30 and I exceed the system requirements. So I had turn off V-sync and SSAO. But maybe the problem is in my PC, I don't know. No matter if you put everything on high it won't make the game pretty. It have this simplistic art style and I love it. This is a design choice. Also the keys are rebindable and you can find a ton of different options in the options menu like Field of View, Difficulty, sound volume and so on. Overall you can find a lot of settings. The year is 1983 and you are send to the research ship Xanadu. She calmly stay around the orbit of a mysterious planet. From a few months her crew hasn't send a single messege. Now alone you have find what happened on the ship. Piece by piece you will put together the story by finding audio logs and pieces paper. Usually I don't searching for both in other games. However in this case I don't know why, but I don't have a problem with that. Keep in mind that this is the only way to understand what happen. The great writting help a lot too. The story begs for more than one playthrough. It have three distinct endings with different requirments to see them and there are a lot of things to find, events to be interpreted. I saw some weird things and make me curious and I wanted to know more, what the dev try to tell with all this symbolism. I like when a game or movie crawls under my skin like that. For me this is smart storytelling. The gameplay is simple. When you arive on Xanandu, you immediately find a lazer gun. So it's part shooter. But the other part is more interesting for me – scavenging hunt. The game is not all about shooting. It's more about adventuring and finding what happen. There three weapons in total – pistol, shotgun and SMG. The shooting is just fine. I complete the game only with the lazer gun, because I didn't find the other two and it's not necessary. They certainly would make my life easier. Like I said it's about the story. There is even a optional “Peacfull” mode. If you don't like shooting robots, you can enable it and just explore the ship, solve puzzles and find what happen. This is such a cool idea. Puzzles are not hard and most of them have common sense. Get something, put it there or remove this. Simple puzzles. Some are kinda obscure and I complete them by accident. Others are obvious, like find a code for a lock door, but where is it, it's the difficult part. There a lot of hidden stuff. The enemies here are all different type of robots. Some are flying and shoot electricity, other shoot lazers, third suicide by exploding near you and finaly a turret with shield. I think it's enough variety, considering the length of the game. Except sound of your gun, the robots you encounter and a little ambient sound, most the time there isn't something else to hear. They are great. This is not a horror game, but it defenently have a creepy atmosphere. Still, you are on a space ship with missing crew, aggressive robots and weird things happening around you. There is almost no music, which is a great idea. The only voice acting you will hear is from the recordings and it's really good. The actors do a great job to let you know how they feel – sad, desperate, drunk and so on. The level design is good. The ship is not a huge and you will familiarize quickly with Xanadu. All room are distinct. There are crew quarters, laboratory, bridge, offices and so on. You have to walk around the ship to piece together the story. The ship is interactive. You can open cabinets, lockers and so on to search for clues. You can even eat, drink and smoke. It's not necessery, unless you want the achievment for that. It's a neet little thing. Also there are mini-games. I found only one, a simple kill all zombies. One of the coolest things here is no hand holding. Not even where to save your game. You arrive on the ship and you are free to go wherever you want. The only way to know where you are are is a map on the walls. It shows your current location. As a whole the ships feel like it came out from 80's sci-fi movies and it's awesome Rarely i've been invested in a game or a movie like this. As i mentioned in the beginning at first glance it's doesn't seems to be anything special. The game don't have high production value, but it doesn't have to. I feel the graphics are a design choice. Don't write off the game. The shooting is solid, but it's not the center of the game. It's the story. When you find out what happen, you can see it's not entirly original, but the way unfolds, what you see, the symbolism is what caught my attention. It's well crafted story. The only thing people might not like is the lenght. I beat it in 2 hours, because i wonder around the ship exploring. Some reach the end in just an hour. But the game begs to be played again and that's why i think the lenght is perfect. I even found something, a secret, that can ease my second playthrough. One final thing. People are saying if System Shock and Deus Ex are making a baby and Kubrick shooting it, this will be the result – Spirits Wideshut 1983 Space Odessy. Actually this is my interpretation of the words. The say it have a System Shock and Deus Ex vibe with a pinch of Kubrick. Go now and buy the game. I highly recommend it.\",\n",
       "  \"First, let me say I've been playing the DRM-free version since 5-23-2015, plus the hours with the Steam one. So don't let that hours mislead you into thinking I've barely played the game. With the visuals, the CGI rendering technique that was used offers up plenty of colors used for the shading and detail in the backgrounds and the individual sprites. There are multiple layers of parallax scrolling that give the backgrounds some nice depth, and for the most part, the animation is pretty fluid. The designs for the bosses and ships are a mix, with some that look a bit generic, to others that are nice looking with some interesting traits. Either way, it's clear that the artist behind the graphics put some real effort into their work. However, there are some spots that really feel like someone slacked off. The explosions for one, look out of place and cheap. They don't match the rest of the visuals at all, and truly look like a generic effect that came prepackaged with some kind of software (Game Maker perhaps?). The graphics also have an unfortunate amount of copy-pasting going on. The very first level features constantly repeating lines of ships in the background, as if you're flying through a parking lot. It's literally the exact same ship over and over and over, both up close and farther away. Other levels suffer from this same issue (stage 2's buildings, stage 3's crashed underwater ship, which results in a cheap look being given to the game, despite the quality of the images themselves. Factor in other issues like how your ship snaps back to its side view when you stop moving vertically, and visibility issues (the missiles fired from the little R-Type looking pod walkers, enemies/shots being hidden in explosions, and it's a game that tries to look really snazzy, but stumbles at times some keys areas. With the sound, there's not much to get excited about. The music is incredibly minimal and very muffled. There are maybe three instruments going at once, and most of the time, the only instrument you can really hear in-game is a strings-like one. Now I say “in-game,” because if you play the ogg vorbis tracks on their own and turn them up, you can hear faint instruments behind those strings; instruments that at times sound out of tempo thanks to an echo effect that was put on them (this is the drums and timpani, namely). But they're so muffled and quiet that they may as well not be there. This makes the compositions empty feeling and leaves them offering nothing to support the action happening on-screen. Factor in that the compositions themselves aren't overly noteworthy, and it's a glaring hole in the game's presentation. The sound effects fair a little better, but not by much. The shots being fired do their job without offending your ears, while enemy shots and missiles do the same thing. As such, those effects work well. But, there's a problem. The sound effects for things like explosions, ships flying onto the screen, missiles being they all have a fair bit of rumble and bass in them. And when you have a bunch of enemies that fly in and get killed at the same time, they all play those bassy effects together. The end result is a too-loud, distorted and crackling mess of sound due to the same kinds of noises being layered over each other. So yeah, the game's aural qualities leave a fair bit to be desired, and don't stack up well against its visuals. The gameplay is straight-forward stuff. You get powerups, you fight bosses at the end of the levels, you blow up ships during the you all know the drill by now. The hit detection is pretty good, and the enemy patterns came at you from all sides as you progress through the levels. You also get a number of powerups that range from missiles and bombs, to fireballs and multi-directional lasers. These also stack up, so if you do well enough, you can have quite the bit of firepower at your disposal. However, this game throws a few unwanted wrinkles into the mix. First, and perhaps most annoying, is that you rarely see a powerup more than once. The forward-angled side shot? Once. The up+down+back shot? Once. The seven way shot? The fireball? The enhanced electrical ball that passes through things? The bomb? All once. The only powerups you see more than one time are the missiles and the various extra life types (a 1up and a star that appears to give you three lives). So if you miss your powerup, it's gone forever. And if you blow it Wait. Did I just say 'blow it up'? Yes, I did. You can blow up your powerups. They can take a few hits, but if you're firing away at a slew of enemies and you're not paying attention when that powerup appears in front of you, it can and will explode if you hit it more than a few times. That someone thought exploding powerups was a good idea to implement, truly baffles me. That such an idea was coupled with how most powerups only show up once, makes for a maddening setup that defies logic. If it was done as a means to be different, then bravo. It's different alright. It's also an absolutely horrid idea that should have been replaced before it ever got programmed. Granted, when you die, you still get to keep your powerups. But that doesn't offset the ludicrousness of it all. Lastly, the bosses in this game are pretty unremarkable when it comes to their battles. They're good design-wise, most of them animate when they fire, and they all start smoking as they get damaged. So visually, they look fine and had some nice touches added to them. But their fire patterns are simple and easily dodged, with most of the bosses simply moving up and down on the other side of the screen. It's only the last two bosses that actually start really moving around the screen more, making for some pretty dull encounters with the other four. This dullness isn't helped at all with how two-thirds of the six bosses can be easily beaten due to the huge safe spots in their simple laser patterns, or because of your being able to destroy what they're shooting at you. Sure, the last three bosses have a kind of “hyper mode” they go into when they're half dead, which then increases the intensity of their attack. But even then, those attacks are usually handled with little trouble. Frankly, only the final boss gives you a real challenge with what it does. So really, the bosses are pretty basic as all they do is shoot. No ramming, no arms to grab at they just shoot, and shoot easily avoided stuff at that. In the end, what can be said about Tiamat X? It tries, I'll give it that. At times, the visuals are quite nice, the controls feel pretty solid, the hit detection's alright for the most part, and at six stages, you'll likely get your worth. But the game's got issues. Various visual and audio problems, iffy and muffled music, little in the way of options to tinker with, no difficulty selection, over half of the game offering little to no real challenge, utterly bizarre choices for how the powerups are all of this really hurts this game. The game's length doesn't help either, as it can be beaten in under 15 minutes. Is the game busted? No. It's quite playable, though I do keep having it crash on me when I try to send my high score to the global tables with the DRM-free version that can be bought elsewhere. But it has some rather glaring flaws that really should have been addressed before this thing went live on Steam. I feel that it was a missed opportunity to spruce it up a bit for a new and wider audience. So to me, the game's a generally nice looking, but very average quality shmup whose main saving grace is its low price. And it's a game that, quite frankly, BBQ Games should have kept cooking on the grill a bit longer before they served it to everyone. Score- out of 10 Finally, here's a playthrough I recorded, if you want to see the game in \",\n",
       "  \"I have a review for this game, but I'm going to type a wall of text here in hopes that you can't see my review. Because I think there's a major point to this game that you can't ever have someone tell you about. I think you have to experience I think you have to feel it. If you can come to that point on your own, it's a beautiful and amazingly well designed game for a very low price. The problem is, in my review I'm going to spoil what I believe the 'secret' point of this game is. I know some of you will click it anyways and miss out. But I'm challenging you. Is $2 really so much to pay to believe in another human being? Just please. Trust me. Don't read the rest of this review until after you've at least played through the game once on your own. For those of you that insist on seeing it now, or for those of you who have played through once and are back now to read this, here is my review: This game is magnificent. It's not amazing as far as gameplay, sound, No. It's clearly not meant to be that type of game, but is any visual novel really about the visuals? They're just an accentuation for the story you're being immersed in. The point of the game is the reason why I love it. I played the game for about 45 minutes. Just one play through. The first ten to fifteen minutes, I was treating it like another silly game I didn't care Halfway through I started really getting interested in the story. It hooks you in and goes from using third person references to saying 'You did this. You remember this. You were sad without you noticing, the game goes from telling you a story about someone else to engaging you in a story about yourself. At some point, I think year seven or so. The stories stop. The family history goes no further. You learn about your parents, how they met. You learn about yourself. You learn about your brothers, and how you struggled. You learn about your first love and how she was your pillar when times got hard. When times became harder she was only there for you more. And then suddenly the history stops. The GAMEPLAY stops. And you're there really a reason to balance your life? To prolong your suffering and loneliness? To keep thinking about things. To keep hoping for another love as deep and fulfilling as the one you lived. And at that point I realized. This game lies to you. The game tells you the point is to keep yourself alive as long as possible. And yes, you can do that for the leaderboards if you like. You can be a robot and experience life in the most optimal way for survival. Or you can do what you feel is right as you come to terms with death. In my own final days, I visited many loved relatives and friends. Put aside money for my children, even when I didn't have any. Went out to theatre and surrounded myself with people I cared for. People stole from me and silly things would bother And one day the money ran out and I died. I cried a little bit I died living to the fullest. And that. That is what I think this game is truly about. It's not a grind to live as long as you can. It's only a grind for as long as it takes for you to realize that grinding your life away is NOT the life you should want to live. At that point the game teaches you something deep about yourself and allows you to come to terms with human mortality. For that reason I believe this game is magnificent. But who knows. I might be seeing magic where there is nothing. Perhaps it wasn't their intention. Regardless, I'm very glad for what I got out of this I'm kind of sad I would have missed it if it wasn't so cheap. 10 out of 10 . Thank you to the people who worked on this gem.\"],\n",
       " 0: [\"This game is I love it. I can't stop playing. It's so easy to lose track of time. I've played 11+ hours and it felt like I only played for 5 hours. People will say it's like minecraft and other games similar but don't knock it till you try it. It's worth the money and I like that you can play with friends. I currently don't have anyone who I know playing this yet, so I have yet to explore the adventure with others. The art style is just sooo cute. I love the slimes the best. This game starts of super cute and fun with the slimes, bunnies and pigs but go into the wrong portal and hell awaits. I think it's a fun way to explore diffrent places and a good way to test how good you are at the game. It may be a little sad when you die and you got so far but each time you play you get better and better. Just don't stay still for a long will face the horrible fate that has come across you.\",\n",

So I'm changing the Recommendation to 'Yes', as long as you get it at 75% off or better) It's a first person shooter with 11 or 12 short levels and no mid-level checkpoints, if you die you have to start the level over. If you quit, you can restart from the first levels that you've gotten to. Some levels are really frustrating, but again they're short. Gameplay is below average - moving around feels 'floaty' and guns feel like toys, but can be ok for some surreal fun and challenge. And as said above, the game is pretty challenging, and is more about dodging the enemies long enough to kill them than 1337 shooting skillz - since the enemies are pretty big and headshots don't count. And of course platforming, because who doesn't like platforming in the first person? So if you just want a good challenge behind a bad FPS, maybe this game is for you. Took me 100 minutes to beat and watch the credits.\",\n",
       "  \"Previously I wrote a review about this game of how I didn't like it. I put the thumbs down for it and called it a day. I have now played though 4 of the 5 Blackwell games (the four that come in a bundle) and would now say that I was relatively pleased with the series. The first game was on a very small budget as Wadjet Eye games was just starting out (the only other game out was The Shivah). I have left my old review up about this game. And while I still dislike many of the elements of the first installment, this game does lay the ground work for some fun future installments and a pretty good series. I give the series a overall. Old Review: I wish there was a maybe button for reviews. I personally did not enjoy the game very much. There were too many things that I did not like about it. Some might like the style and actually enjoy the game, so here were my pro's and con's. Pro's: Good storyline, Interesting Characters Con's: Puzzles were too easy, only two functions for the game (not like a classic point and click, Look At, Pick Up, Push, Pull, Talk To), the game was too short, and the art was not that great (game looked like it was made in the 1990's instead of 2006, but look at the pictures and decide for yourself). Some people love shorter games with easier puzzles. And if you really like mystery, then this might be the game for you.

       "  \"Binding of Isaac has become one of my favourite indie games and there is no surprise why: Starting a new game I was already amused by the classic 'room battles' with almost a different foe each time. When reaching my first treasure rooms I felt a sense of satisfaction that I was being rewarded for my progress, the item I collected not only transformed my abilities but transformed isaac himself! I instantly knew that I needed these items to survive this game let alone improve my character, making looting a very important part of the game. After my exploring and looting I finally came across to the boss room and in turn, my first challenge! Although this was the first room therefore the easiest boss, I felt a little helpless as it was my first encounter and had no idea what this boss was capable of which made the fight much more exciting for me. Unfortunately my first playthrough was cut short in the second stage (stupid pointers getting a lucky shot). Starting up a second playthrough I noticed the changes straight away, the levels were completely different from the first! The layout of the floor, items rewarded, even the boss had completely changed! This is what makes Binding of Isaac so addicting for me, it's never the same twice. Now I've covered the experience playing the game yet I still have so much to talk about! Being run on flash it works ridiculously well; there is rarely any lag at all and I can't say that I've witnessed any crashes or glitches, you can tell this game was very well put together and a large amount of effort and care was put into making this the perfect indie game. Another part of the game is the beautiful music, oh the music! Words are not enough to tell you guys how much I love this soundtrack; its simple yet catchy tune when exploring the first floor, fast-paced battle theme that really gets you in the mood for victory! I love how eerie and darker the music starts to get as you progress further down the basement. There's not one negative thing that can be said about this soundtrack. Hat's off to you, Dan! Personally, after getting to know the back story of this game (not saying anything about it because spoilers) this has really got me to tell my mother how much I love her :( displays that games can hit you on a much deeper level. I've been playing Binding of Isaac now for at least half a year, I've achieved so much and beaten the game many times, I've even brought Wrath of The Lamb Expansion (but a review on that is for another day). But I still think that I've not fully 'completed' the game therefore I'm still enjoying it as much as I did on my first playthrough, no matter how many times I click on the 'start' button :) So the question is this: would I recommend this game to be played by any kind of gamer and not just indie lovers? Its a big fat yes, this will be the best you'll ever spend on steam!\",\n",
       "  \"Before i jump into things im gonna go ahead and say that this game has a pretty great concept and decent delivery. For the price it is definitely worth it. To start off, the gameplay essentially goes like this. You can pick two weapons before you spawn, with a fairly decent selection although if you want to build anything you will have to select the miner gun as one of them, which is almost useless for attacking. You are then spawned into an arena with other players made up of tiny little bricks which can be destroyed, or built on with bricks of your own. The combat is fairly skill based, while still being somewhat friendly to new players, and if you haven't gotten very good at the game yet you will get killed alot, but will likely still have enough moments where you pull off an awesome stunt to make it enjoyable. The game does give you the ability to build with the minergun, but i find that there isn't really enough of a focus on construction especiallly in the deathmatch mode to really make it worth your time. Not to say it can't be fun to build up a base, but the gameplay is so fast paced that you will likely be killed alot by the other players/zombies while trying to do so. One thing that is worth mentioning is that i believe this game was originally designed for the Xbox, and then ported over to the PC, so if your playing on the PC the gameplay can feel pretty 'klunky' at times and just generally unsatisfactory. The graphics are nothing special, but they are pretty good for what they are. I especially like the ability to customize your characters colours and helmet. Listening for the sounds that other players are making can be helpfull sometimes, but can also just confuse you too, since you there is almost no difference between a sound made all the way across the map and a sound that is 30 feet away from you. It only really starts to get louder if a player is closer than about 25 feet to you. I have heard people say that there aren't enough players on this game, which is understandable considering that this game is very old. However, although i would certainly like to see more people online and hosting games, i have never personally been completely unable to find someone to play with. Especially since my computer is good enough to host games without serious lag issues. However, especially if your computer can't host games, this might be something you want to consider. (By the way the process for hosting a server is easy, no port forwarding or Overall, i give this game a out of 10. This game is nowhere near perfect, but it can still be a good load of fun to play especially if you've got a couple of friends to play it with. And considering the insanely cheap price, i would say it is well worth your money.\"],\n",

       " 5: [\"Many people call Enter the Gungeon the better Isaac or Nuclear Throne and in many ways it is. The game features better combat than Isaac though in my opinion it's not quite on the level of Nuclear Throne and has more item variety and more guns than Nuclear Throne even though Isaac beats Enter the Gungeon in this aspect as it has more items that have more unique synergies. So it's a decent mix between Isaac and Nuclear Throne and takes advantage of some good aspects of both of those titles. If you like those games, Enter the Gungeon is an easy buy. The presentation is great, the combat is good. But here are some of the problems: Just like Isaac some runs you're going to get screwed by RNG and either get useless guns or run out of ammo for your good guns in no time. But in Isaac you can often redeem your bad run by playing well and getting a deal with the devil which will, mostly, provide you with great items. Gungeon is different. Many guns might be cool for 5 minutes while you figure out what they do but after that period of time is over you're left with a gun that feels useless against most bosses. There aren't any OP items/guns in the same way as there are in Isaac. On the one hand this makes the game more skill-reliant but on the other hand this makes the combat feel frustrating in many cases since basic enemies on later levels often take 6-8 hits from your AK-47. The problem is: the enemies' HP scales based on the level you are on which makes the combat progressively more frustrating as you play. For example: on the first level an AK-47 takes down basic enemies in 3 hits, while on the fourth floor the same enemy takes twice as many hits from the gun. Not only does this make you feel like your guns are useless, but it also causes you to run out of ammo frequently and thusly forcing you to either use a bad gun or your even worse starting weapon. I have no problems with later enemies having more HP, but the same enemies having progressively more HP based on the level you are on is a cheap way of increasing difficulty in my opinion. The solution to this is easy: just remove the HP-scaling and the combat will feel better and your ammo won't run out as frequently. The game might be easier as result but it won't be too easy as it very difficult even without scaling HP. And more importantly: It would be more fun. Overall I still think the game is good since the gameplay is fun, there is a lot of weapon variety and the art style is very well executed. I just wish some of the guns would feel more powerful and HP-scaling wasn't a thing. If that were the case, I would happily jump on the It's-Better-Than-Isaac-Hype-Train. As it is currently, I would recommend it to fans of the rogue-lite genre but those who haven't played The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne, I'd recommend those titles over this one.\",\n",
       "  \"I would like to make clear that I only got the free version of this game so my experience related within this review can only be based upon the free version and none of the paid versions of the game. Four words desricbe this tummy bannana rub' (I could do it in less words, but not here) stars for the free version, the need to be super awesome or pay money to get more weps to strip is why I rate it down a bit Other than that I enjoyed my gun tummy bannana rub. Mainly because I have stripped and re-assembled various models of the AK-47 and M1911 and put them back together lots as a child. MODELS! not real ones! The ingenuity of the mechanisms in guns has always astonished me. This game shows all that engineering genius in the simplicity of the working parts in reasonably good detail, static and functioning. There is also a shooting range that is unlockable through experience earned or bought. One gripe from me, is that some pieces would not let me dissasemble them before I took apart another unrelated was no logical reason why I could not remove that part. This has happened in both the first two weapons and makes playing the super game mode more a 'Learn what order your taught to do it' rather than ' I got a screwdriver and there is a screw, I should be able to take it out now' You are then left with the looming fact that unless you learn those first 3 guns inside out and the correct order to do EVERYTHING you are going to have to pay money to get more guns. Oh, there is a 'Bonus' part where you can dissasemble a human in a gun game ? What? well, I done it anyway and put it back together again hoping to get enough experience to unlock something .. but no, it was not to be. 300XP didn't put a dent the 5000XP I needed for the next gun. There are other are cars. As that last bit was totally confusing, we are just going to move on with the gun stuff. The question is , how much do you like guns? the first is an AK-47 and then a M1911. These weapons are a pleasure to strip and put back together (for me anyways) I do have a personal favourite that I am tempted to get,,, it looks like it will cost me a fiver though :( For me, I personally would really only get enjoyment out of weapons I am familair with. Last words are this, Try it, its actually educational and seeing the brutal simplicity of a death dealing tool in action is quite something.\",\n",
       "  \" Edit and clarification below The day has finally come, I backed this game back on Kickstarter close to 3 years ago and IT'S HERE I have been eagerly anticipating the release of this game forever and BOY does it deliver. First things first, don't go into SUPERHOT expecting a lengthy and 'mind blowing' story. I have seen quite a few reviews from people criticizing the game because 'the story is 2 hours'. I for one love the short story, it has a Cronenberg 'Videodrome' vibe (especially when you hunt for the numerous secrets). After finishing the campaign you unlock tons of endless and challenge modes as well as hidden secrets within all the levels. This is where the meat of the game lies. There are also a handful of mini games in the menu that are quite entertaining. If you have seen any gameplay you know what to expect. This IS a 'one trick pony' as they say. However, this one trick is executed with perfection . The aesthetic of this game is just gorgeous, the sound design is superb, the art style is crisp and clean, the DOS era theme of the game menus is very polished, and the controls are as tight as can be. 'Killstagram' (Now called 'SUPERHOT Video' for PC reasons I imagine) is also a really sweet and unique feature. You can seamlessly upload replays in game to / to be shared on social media. All in all this is a fantastic game, I am a big fan of endless games and I will be putting many of hours into this. Easily one of my favorite FPS games. BODIES ARE DISPOSABLE GIVE US NAMES GIVE US YOUR FRIENDS WE NEED MORE OBEY SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT EDIT: Right, alot of downvotes because I am not bashing the game with an ignorant and/or snarky three sentence review.

So, when you buy and then write a 'wtf 2 hours for 25 dollars!1!1' negative review you are making yourself look like a fool, and perpetuating a fallacy. I agree SUPERHOT isn't for everyone. As I stated before, complaining the story wasn't long enough AFTER FULLY KNOWING IT IS AIMED AT ENDLESS AND CHALLENGE MODES is utterly absurd. SUPERHOT was funded for the SOLE purpose of having tons of endless and challenge modes. If people bashing the game bothered to research before purchasing they would have known this. If you even did a quarter of the challenges available you would get your moneys worth. Criticizing a game for what it isn't trying to be is the very definition of entitlement. I legitimately haven't seen a vaild criticism of the game yet besides 'hurr durr it's 2 hours'. Look at the description, it doesn't even mention a campaign. This game is probably one of the best to come from crowdfunding, it delivered EXACTLY what the backers wanted. At the end of the day whether or not it is worth the price is dependent on what you think of the time slowing mechanic. If you saw the mechanic and went 'meh' you will be bored probably within three hours. If you were fascinated by a revolutionary step in an otherwise stagnant FPS genre seeing thousands of opportunities, you will be occupied for HOURS. EDIT 2: I have never been one to take Steam reviews as the gospel. Especially now after seeing all the negative 2 sentence snarky reviews getting thrust to the top of the SUPERHOT page. I am very glad that the critical reception has been very positive. However, in the user Steam reviews I have seen a vocal minority insulting the dev's artistic vision, questioning their character, even going as far as to call them 'disingenuous'. Frankly, it is really childish to me to hate a game just because it wasn't what you expected. I wish the team the best of luck and I hope they make enough cash to embark on another endeavor, they deserve it.\",\n",
       "  \"Gungeon is the kind of game that other people are going to scrutinize and say 'But if I've already got The Binding of Isaac, I don't need to play this one, dude!' Stop. Put that thought out of your head. Isaac and Gungeon are two entirely different beasts. Isaac's game is structured and fractal, asking you to play the game many, many times in different forms and with different characters to reach 'the true ending'. Gungeon's game is more straightforward - you have a dude, and that dude wants to get the gun to kill his past, and there's a giant pit between you and that gun that is filled with adorable bullets that use guns to shoot bullets at you. There's also shotgun shells that use shotguns to shoot shotgun pellets for you. There's also a knight with a sword, but he uses the sword to shoot bullets at you. There's also a skeleton made out of bullet casings, but he shoots you with lasers. Basically, this game is incredibly adorable, but you must not drop your gun and hug the smiling bullets or you will get shot by the bullets shooting bullets at you. It's complicated, but less so, because it's all about getting to the end game (there is a sub-quest where you have to construct a bullet for the gun that kills your past, but that's about it). In both games, you can coast if you manage to put together a good loadout! In Gungeon, getting a good loadout requires a bit of luck and knowing which guns are best for which situations. Some guns are best for crowds of enemies, some guns are best for bosses, some guns are just jokes in gun form, and some guns will go through all of your ammo before you know it. You'll eventually know which ones are best through usage and experience. There's also the issue of Mastery - in Gungeon, you start out with three hearts, like a Zelda. But unlike Zelda, if you are fortunate enough to defeat a boss without taking a hit, you earn an extra heart container. You take one bullet, and you can kiss that heart container goodbye. You will lose a lot (like you would in a proper Roguelike) before you manage to win one time, but oh man, if you make it, you can shoot a dragon in the face! Medieval people never got the opportunity to do that. You are blessed. You were born in the right generation. The soundtrack and the graphics are aces. Doseone's soundtrack is at the same time incredibly energetic and subliminally hypnotic, fitting the weird gun dungeon to a T. The graphics are pixel graphics, but they're the really neat, detailed kind. That won't stop sad nerds and millenials from crying about how pixel graphics are the bane of their existence inbetween emailing developers and publishers about how they should 'get a graphics department'. If I had to suggest something for the game to knock off and stop doing: The referential humor gets a bit much at times. I appreciate a good reference to other video games and I definitely know that if you don't have the AK-47 in a game that's all about how many guns it has, you're not doing your job right. But some of the video game guns are just plain references and that's kind of lazy. Plus, a universe where there's bullets that use guns to shoot bullets is kind of the bonkers universe that needs to be expanded upon! Gungeon's great. There's a gun that is called a Microtransaction gun and it just shoots items from collector's editions of video games into the faces of your enemies. So if you've ever wanted to kill someone by throwing your overpriced figurine from that video game you like so much, now's your chance, weirdo.\",\n",

       " 7: [\" Gameplay: It's okay, but feels a little thin. Using a shotgun and certain abilities feels pretty satisfying, but the melee combat is pretty bland. It lacks the depth of a good roguelike, and there are certain things that keep it from having the flow they were looking for. The crafting system seems big and complicated, but honestly I don't care enough about it to really want to use it. The story mode is pretty boring and honestly not that great from what I've seen so far. Endless mode is a bit more but for that, I feel like I have a dozen games that do this type of thing 10x better. Controls/UI: It feels like it was made for consoles/tablets first, and haphazardly ported to PC. You can't rebind the controls, and if you want to use a controller, you have to go edit filenames to make sure the included controller preset file for your type of controller is named and you better hope they included a preset for your controller, since there are only like 4 availible. I'm not kidding. This is VERY LAZY on the developer's part, and I imagine some users who aren't so great with computers will struggle with this. In-game menu, please! Is that so much to ask? The keyboard controls are wiggity-whack. Why can't 'I' be inventory? E for equipment? Q or L for Questlog? S or K for skills? You know, like most roguelike/lite games? You can move with QWEASDZC, the numpad, the mouse, or the left-stick on the controller. Facing different directions is easy enough on controller, since you just use the right-stick, but to turn with the keyboard you have to hold space and press a direction. It's very clunky. I hear an update is coming soon that will allow users to rebind via (you guessed it!) an INI file. ugh. IN. GAME. MENU. PLEASE. The controls are much more bearable with my 360 controller during actual gameplay, but are slow and annoying to use in the inventory menus. The UI is full of big buttons, and menus that pop out of the sides of the screen. It looks like a tablet game. You have 3 levels of zoom. 'way too close' 'okay, but I'd like to zoom out maybe just a little' and 'way too far away' Sound: The sounds and music are pretty good. Not great, not just alright. Graphics: Kinda pre-rendered 3D-esque nice shaders and effects. It looks pretty nice, though sometimes walls and other objects on the terrain just get in the way of me seeing what I'm doing. The graphics are one of this game's strongest but sometimes the big sprites and terrain objects are just too much. In Wait and see if the devs get their act together on the and maybe see if it goes on sale or something. At this time, I wouldn't recommend it. Certainly not at full price.\",\n",

It was a blast to sit in front of the TV late at night with my buddies trying over and over again to get our fearless hero, Abe, through a variety of puzzles and fun obstacles. The reboot, is no different. The game itself looks great and offers me that same excitement or at least it would if the game worked with my controller. I have a Logitech F310 controller that works great with most games, and I assumed it would work with New n Tasty. No dice. I saw on the games page that it had full controller support; but neglected to see that they meant Xbox controllers only. Is that really full controller support? Isn't that partial controller support? I later found out they were working on a fix to add additional controller support to include mine. Great! I played through most of the game on a mouse and keyboard, but found the game play more irritating than enjoyable. In my opinion, this game needs to be played with a controller. That's how it was originally designed when it was released in the 90's. When the patches came, my controller still didn't work. I sent an email to support to see if they would help me. No response. I waiting for the second patch that insisted that it fixed all controller issues. Still no improvement. Another patch came out that would let gamers remap the controls if they could get into the game files and then write out the code. I WOULD NEVER HAVE PAID MONEY FOR A GAME I HAD TO PARTIALLY DEVELOP SIMPLY TO GET IT TO WORK. There's has been another bug fixed released that promises it fixes all of my troubles but it doesn't. In fact, I'm pretty sure it did nothing at all. The developers have been nothing short of rude and unhelpful by not responding to my inquires and not offering me a refund for an incomplete game. In short: This whole experience has wasted my time, money and patience. It's a sad rip off of what was once my favorite game.\",\n",

You play as the only human in a school of birds and the object of the game is to form meaningful relationships with them. Yep, that's right, you're gonna pull yourself some sweet pigeon booty. Coo Coo. It seriously feels like a parody on the dating sim genre at best. The writing is mediocre at best with most of the birds being just as much as an oddball as the main character. The birds personalities do fall flat at time, but what really ties the game together is the 'true ending' which can only be obtained by playing through every bird's route. The true ending manages to effortlessly weave the links between all of the birds and Hiyko together leading to a story that has twists, surprises and tearjerking moments. The conclusion is satisying and enough to convince me that although this is a game with a ridiculous concept, it's meant to be taken seriously and not as the joke as it seems. Overall, Hatoful Boyfriend is a quirky game with a colourful cast of birds to romance and with enough twists and turns to remain fresh for every playful. The ability to fast forward through scenes is much appreciated and the game isn't a joke, no matter how hard it seems like one.\",\n",
       "  \"Like many, I was touched by Freebird Games' first game 'To The Moon', one of the most emotional games I have ever played. So how does 'A Bird Story' stack up compared to that game? As you have probably already seen in the screenshots, both games are made in RPGmaker. Most people either love or hate RPGmaker games, personally I do not really care as long as the game is good. Aside from the graphics, A Bird Story does differ a lot from To The Moon. The first difference is the length of the game, To The Moon was not a very long game but it still was a lot longer than A Bird Story, which only should take you one hour to complete. Second difference is there are no conversations, unlike To The Moon where you would get sucked in the story, A Bird Story takes on a different, more art-like story. The third difference is that A Bird Story is a 'feel good' game and no tearjerker like To The Moon. So yes, both games differ quite a lot from each other, which is not a bad thing. Both games are good in their own way, you just should not expect a game like To The Moon, even though it has some moments that reminds you of To The Moon. Overall 'A Bird Story' is recommended to anyone who enjoys 'art' games and want a nice 1-hour experience. \",\n",

It has a bunch of bird puns, lots of comedy, and everything is around birds! The only thing that I kinda don't like is the save feature, but there really isn't anything that can be done about that.

I really tried to like this game - well, it´s more of an interactive movie (and you don´t really have that much interaction either) - but i just can´t. It doesn´t feel right. !!!SPOILER!!! You sit in front of the monitor and you see the story about a little boy, who is alone almost all of the time because his mother seems to work a lot or whatever and he doesn´t have any friends either. But then he finds and rescues this little bird and helps him ro recover from his injury. They become 'friends'. And as you can allready guess, he can´t keep the bird and so the story begins and is almost at the end allready. ! Spoiler end ! pros and cons about it: + great soundtrack + great visuals + good story + emotional - very short (i needed just 70 minutes to 'finish' it) - kind of boring (you barely do anything at all other than dont get me wrong, it´s a good 'game' for those who liked to the moon or similar games, but a birds story doesn´t feel as statisfying as to the moon when you have finished it. It feels like there should be 'more'. Or at least something else. TDLR: 'A Birds Story' is like the foreplay.

There is something much deeper here. But I heard about this game a long time ago, don't quite remember where, but I know I did. Then saw it again once as a commercial in an EB Games store. Didn't really care at the time. I though 'WTF? A pigeon dating game?? Several months later, I see it here, on Steam, on sale at 75% off. And at that The Spoke to I know in my time that if I can feel something calling out to me, I must listen, for it must mean something good. And it hasn't failed me once.

Wasn't sure what I was doing. Stopped for a day, then tried again. Went the Ryouta route, 'cause he's protagonist's best friend, why not? And Feels started I wasn't expecting it. Now, I really love stories in a video game. Not sure why, I just do. And this game was no exception! I continued playing it, knowing more about the different characters, their stories, getting all sorts of emotions, and loving it. Now, have you ever fell in love?

I bought the game on Winter Sale, cause I neede some game to compare with Orion Prelude (let's be clear: something to say 'You know, the Orion is not cool, but *game name* is really awesome') And with this think I bought Dino D-Day. When I started it, I got not bad plot. It was a little trashy and irrealistic, but that's the thing I liked in it. Not even a history book will tell us a story about Hitler who created GdDmnd DINOSAURS! Wat the hell? - Thought I and got that this thing is very little (cause there's no campaign and the idea won't be developed more) and funny aspect of this game. What is evident that it's another CS:S clone with changed models and they ask money for this. But IMHO dat game is interesting firstly because of classes and some variety of weapons to choose from (yeah, it's not Borderlands or TF2, but it's something) and Dinosaurs. Nothing special, not so much things that could be described by 1000 and more words, but Dino D-Day is 'quite' game. I mean it made with a plenty of love and wish of creators to make a good game :) Personally, I recommend it for everyone who wishes to play CS:S with Dinos and will not be made to pay extra money Do you hear me, Orion? By the way, I didn't mention this game in that review, if you're interested (but this game, if you ask me, more playable that OP) , cause if we'll compare this 2 games, we'll get that Dino D-Day is featureless game, but made good and nice-optimyzed, while we have absolutely different situation with O:P Have a nice day, pals.

       "  \"This is a huge improvement on the first Primal Carnage game. In fact, this is one of the best dinosaur/fighting games, I've ever played! Other than ORION: Prelude, I don't know of very many dinosaur games that have both options to play as humans and dinosaurs. Also, the graphics, animations, models, textures, and sound effects are extremely awesome! The new Acrocanthosaurus is awesome, too! The more dinosaurs, the marrier! And I really love that some of the game modes (Dino Deathmatch, at least) actually allow you to play as a dinosaur and still fight other dinosaurs, like in the prehistoric times! It gives the dinosaurs a bigger challenge! I haven't played the first Primal Carnage, but I've heard that it doesn't allow you to play as a dinosaur and fight other dinosaurs, like in Extinction. And if that's true, I think that's one of the major advantages Primal Carnage Extinction has over the first Primal Carnage. I completely recommend this game for any gamer who loves dinosaurs!\",\n",
       "  \"It's not so surprising that this game doesn't have a lot of players. At first, the prospect of fighting with friends against hordes of dinosaurs sounds very fun and exciting. Unfortunately, it gets old really fast. The first game you play will probably be the most fun you have with Orion: Dino Horde and then afterwards the novelty wears off. The game has a variety of multiplayer modes but only 2 or 3 that are actively played. Every game rewards you with EXP to increase your level but you don't recieve anything when you increase in level. The content that you experience at level 0 will be the same at the level cap. The game mode that has the most potential for fun is Rampage. Rampage is a Human vs Dinosaur game mode in which players are allowed to play as the dinosaurs alongside AI controlled dinosaurs. It's just unfortunate that right from the get go, the dinosaur team can play as any dinosaur. Right from the beginning of the match, all dinosaur players can select the strongest dinosaurs available like the T-Rex. But all of that is moot because the human team has the overwhelming advantage. Humans can, with upgraded jumps and jetpacks, reach the highest mountain and rain down hell on the dinosaur players. Most of the playable dinosaurs are land based and don't have the ability to jump. The T-Rex has a ranged attack, but with limited distance and a small hitbox. There are a few flying dinosaurs, but they are all too weak to do any considerable damage. The balance issues between human and dinosaur are a result of all the maps being open environments with high peaks. A close quarters indoor environment reminiscient of Jurassic Park would have made for exciting matches and would give more opportunities to using some of the smaller dinosaurs and still be effective. On to the graphics. One word? Meh. The maps are nice enough. Though they suffer from plain textures and too much bloom. Most times you won't even notice the art because there's really nothing to draw your eye to it. Dinosaur models are okay. But player models are just terrible. The low poly and muddy textured player models look like they've been copied from the original Tribes game. The graphics are not a good show of what the Unreal 3 engine can do. Considering I bought the game on a sale, I can't complain, but this is not a well made game. It runs on the gimmick of fighting dinosaurs but ends up being boring and just genuinely not fun. I wouldn't recommend it.\",\n",

       " 14: [\"So let me begin by saying that this really isn't much of a game so much as it is a light novel. What Sakura Spirit is, is simply a lot of well drawn images mixed with a lot of text. I have to give the artists credit with their ability to draw, but other than that there isn't much else. Let's start with the story. It starts off interestingly enough and yes I read all of it. There is one choice in this manga that you can make and it doesn't really have much of an impact, in fact it just shows your a different point of view. The most you're going to have to do is really read and click. That's it. Each of the characters do have their own quirks and characteristics but it's really hard to translate who the characters are with still images and text so it leaves a lot to the player to make connections to the characters themselves. Overall though, the story itself is mostly just a male fantasy with a bunch of girls continually hitting on you and you really have no option but to take it and really do nothing about it. It's pretty linear, straightforward and it's not exactly executed well. The fact that you never really see the male protagonist, who is named and already has a personality really breaks player immersion as well, contributing to the aspect that this isn't a game. Visuals: Okay now this is where this manga's strong points really are. Every image is well drawn, and really pretty. You can tell the artists had fun drawing the characters in different poses but there isn't enough. My major quirk is that this isn't animated. It's a lot of still frames with a few scenes having the same characeter with the three different progessional still frames to show them in different states. But most of the time its just a single still frame. The art could have been really amazing if they had animated the scenes, granted it would have been A LOT more work, but at the same time it's something that you should be prepared to put in while you're working on a game or if your art in general is going to be the fundamental focus of your game. Gameplay. Overall if they made this more actiony, gave the player more freedom in choices and some cool combat, this would actually be a game, and I could see it as being something entertaining. There would be a break in the constant slow pace of reading through paragraphs of dialogue and allow more control for the player that a game should give. Rating: his game should be rated around pg-13 or a little higher, its nowhere near 18+. It has suggestive dialogue, and while there is some nudity it's all suggestive and covered. You will not see anything. I played this game in my lecture hall because of how tame it was. My suggestion, if you're going to go for it, give it 100% don't bother holding back. My recommendation: T If you're looking for a really light, linear manga with really pretty images and a lot of suggestive content. Then sure, I can see that you may get some enjoyment from this, otherwise, I can't really recommend this for anyone. For those looking for some form of hentai buy the game, support the devs, but it isn't worth it. There was a lot more that could have been done, and I hope the devs really try and push what they can do with their other work.\",\n",

This game didn’t really do anything for me at all and I barely put any time at all into it (probably the reason why I didn’t enjoy it as much as others seem to have), but I can certainly see why so many people loved it. I tried my best to review this as objectively as possible and have used that to decide that this game deserves a “recommended” review. LISA is set in a post-apocalyptic setting about a man called Brad who stumbles upon the last girl on earth. After keeping her safe from the rest of the men on the planet for many years while raising her as his own daughter, the secret is out and leagues of pervy men arrive to kidnap her. While the story is interesting enough, it never really caught my attention. It’s sarcastic humour and meta jokes combined with the depressing, hopeless and sometimes boring background story or characters left a bad taste in my mouth, though I can certainly see how it could be equally as amazing for another person. This game doesn’t really bring anything new to the table, but it doesn’t do too many things wrong either. It’s an average, 2D-plane, occasional platformer with turn-based combat. While I like the added depth of special combo’s Brad and the other members of his party can use to inflict extra damage on their enemies if the player can remember the right combinations, as the game progresses you don’t get to do anything new. One thing I really dislike about the combat system is that there isn’t an enemy health bar at all. This can cause issues when in a particularly difficult and long fight, leaving you to feel like it might never very vanilla and seems to be modelled after the classic model RPG, so if you’re into that, this game is for you! The platforming is mostly there to flesh out the scenery or reveal a little comedic scene. If you’re not careful though, you’ll continue on a cliff to the side of the screen, only to discover that it ended without any warning and you’ve just lost 500 HP. One thing I really liked about this game are the choices it makes you take as you play. These choices will alter how you play the game, and definitely personalize the whole experience. For example, you could bribe an enemy instead of fighting him, sacrifice party members instead of your own arm, or even partake in optional mini-games (like russian roulette) that could either make or break your gaming experience. These choices really help the player realize exactly how hopeless and desolate this world is. The art style and music choices of this game were very clever. The scenes and backgrounds are very beautiful, colourful and vibrant, and the music is invigorating and upbeat yet somehow do not clash with the macabre feeling of the story Overall, I can see why this game is as loved by many as it is. There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the game, the story is interesting, the game is playable, the art style is both beautiful and yet depressing and it certainly has enough gameplay hours for the price of it. If you’re a fan of RPG’s and hopeless efforts, I would recommend this for you as long as you’re sure that it’s something that you’ll love.

       "  'HuniePop is an anime style match-3 dating sim that does not take itself to serious. In the game you can date and later sex up to twelve girls, 8 are instantly available 2 are unlocked later and 2 are secret unlocks. They are all well written and have some good voice acting, so you never really need to read what they are saying, if you dont want. The dating works through a match-3 game, similar to others in the genres, but with some interesting unique mechanics in there. After your 4th date you can get a girl to stay over, it is not animated though. The difficulty scales well throughout the game, but you can also set the difficulty to easy or hard in the options if you want. The art style is very good for a low buddget anime game and the girls look all really good, which keeps you in. The game is really cliche and sexist at times, which may be a downside for some people, but it is also self aware of it and makes fun of it. The game can be funny if you dont have a problem with the racism and like the randomness of some conversations and what-the-f moments. As one can probably see, I really liked the game. The only negative I can really say is that if you just want it for the erotic/hentai aspect and cant dig the dating sim or the match-3 stuff it will probably be overprised for you, also since it is not very lenghthy and there is nothing to do besides talking to the girls, looking for presents for them and dating them. But I would not say it is not diversified. The game mixes the management parts and the puzzle parts well enough to keep things varied. I really enjoyed the game and it is so far one of my favourite games this year.',\n",
       "  \"Another gift, another visual novel centered around giving you an erection. I had literally no idea what this game was about. No, I did not skip 90% of the dialouge and only stared at the CG images like most of the people that bought this game, I read through it and I still don't know what's going on. Sakura Spirit at least had something you could follow, you were warped to some sort of past dimension with fox spirit girls with large breasts, in Go! Go! Nippon! you were Weeaboo McBasement going to visit two internet friends with large breasts (well one of them at least) in Japan. In Sakura Angels you play as Socially Awkward Protagonist™, who is on his way to school but suddenly you get attacked by Satan! But luckily two big breasted girls in skimpy outfits come save you. Or you run away (yes, this game has multiple choices!) but run into the two anyway. These two turn out to be some sort of guardian angels (hence the same I guess) that protect the world from evil, which turns to be lurking at Socially Awkward Protagonist's™. Now here's the thing with the two girls: at day they're generic waifu material schoolgirls and at night they become some sort of rescue rangers or Sailor Moons and fight Satan and/or tentacle monsters or that mean white-haired girl from school. If there is one thing I can appreciate in terms of characters, it's the fact that this time our protagonist isn't so full of respect that he doesn't even dare to admire his guardian angels looks like our good old friend Default McProtagonist from Sakura Spirit. In some occasions he even dares to stare at pink-haired girl's butt, which is already a great step-up from Sakura Spirit. ANYWAY, remember those multiple choices I mentioned before? Turns out that the choices that are related to the two girls actually affect the kinda. You can either chose to always root for blonde boobs or pink-haired boobs OR if you need two waifu in your laifu, you can pick both by just altering between the two, yes this is some heavy stuff. The other choices don't affect the story at all, you just read some different dialouges. At first it may seem to bring a bit more variety, but as it turns out it's really nothing life-changing. This game suffers from the same problem as the other two games, the storyline is not interesting enough so they just market the game with the barely dressed, big-chested ladies, which works for most people, and I could forgive the whole '90% boobs, 10% story' thing, if they really tried with the art. The thing with these visual novel games is that the art for every character is just one image that changes it's face every now and then with the occasional CG image that's only there for you screencap, might as welll just sell those images for 5 bucks because that's the only reason people buy this. However, if there's one thing I can mark off as good is the fact that they at least tried with the multiple choice thing, but out of this, Sakura Spirit and GGN, GGN still takes the cake with actually giving you a different line of plot depending on what your choices are. This game tries, but that is still underwhelmed by the sexualization of every female in it. I can't even think of good jokes at this point/10.\",\n",
       "  \"It's a damn shame that games like these will forever be overshadowed by games like Undertale, that got oodles of media attention. Hell, after the game was released and people were saying 'If you liked Undertale, you should play LISA! It's even better', people flocked to play this and the positive review percentage dropped like a lead balloon. These games are not similar, and people need to stop comparing the two. But I digress, on with the review. In comparison to Undertale, which takes inspiration from the themes of Earthbound, LISA follows the source material much closer. LISA is a much more traditional, turn-based RPG where you play as a man called Brad, living in the barren world of Olathe as he finds the last girl left on earth, and swears to protect her with his life. Story: 11/10. I'm not even joking, I don't think I can pop this thing any higher. When it comes to 'masterpieces' in video game storytelling, some either tell an epic tale with in-depth lore and feel, or some hit your emotions hard, and this is one of those games in which mixes a balance of lore and a deep, underlying meaning on the concept of masculinity. Just please, don't spoil it for yourself, whatever you do. This is something that has to be played entirely blind. Gameplay: 8/10 - Where some people say the gameplay behind LISA was repetitive and dull, I found the amount of creativity in the battle system incredibly engaging, and loved the use of story telling through subtle actions and notions done by the characters during certain battles. Like many RPGs, LISA is your typical four-man party member turn-based game, recruiting party members with different roles to help your team. Where LISA differentiates from the rest, however, is how the combat is executed. There are lots of creative buffs and debuffs that you'd realistically think would occur in a world containing only men, such as depression, being drunk and even smelling pretty bad. Everything feels fresh and new, while keeping to a traditional RPG format, and that's something I can really appreciate with a battle system like this. LISA's world is another thing that really helps the game stand out, as unlike most games that rely on a 3d perspective, LISA's overworld plays out like a 2d platformer, with certain areas being unreachable without certain items. This is used very well in a few gimmicky segments to help mix up the gameplay progression, but I won't be spoiling those here. The game also comes bundled with a hard mode, entitled 'PAIN Mode', in which after using a save point, it cannot be used again, as well as the game in general being more difficult and having new encounters. This is really the mode that the game should be default to, in my opinion, as many of the game's features like the expendable party member roulette are seemingly meaningless in emotional value when you can simply savescum your way through it. Presentation: 9/10 - Although the art style might be outdated, it stands out as being unique and different to other RPGs on the market, while still retaining that feeling of familiarity from its Earthbound inspiration. Every character looks and feels unique, with everyone having their own personality and traits. Soundtrack: 10/10 - The composition work is truly a treat to behold with this one, with excellent use of leitmotifs and bizarre themes used throughout to further enforce that feeling of being alone in a strange place. It's exactly how I'd see a game like Earthbound's sountrack being made in the current era of games, and it really hits the feelings it needs to well. Not one song in the game is forgettable, and for that, I can praise the soundtrack with everything I have. Aside from a few technical limitations due to RPG maker being what it is (Some slower load times in areas, which for how intensive the game should be, is abysmal to experience), the game is a must-play. People may complain about the gameplay, but you really only play RPGs for the story, right? And it's not like you'd want to play it twice for how emotionally devastating the story is, anyway. 10/10 masterpiece, and I look forward to Austin Jorgensen's future endeavours.\"],\n",
       " 15: [\"Eldevin: The Grinder's Game, as a f2p game, I do really enjoy Eldevin. By far it has the best f2p model out of any game I've ever seen. Instead of penalizing you for not being a supporter, you have access to 100% of the game without any restrictions, being a supporter just gives you buffs, and overall makes the game more easily playable later down the road with things such as double relic gain to increase the speed in which you get armor sets and so on. So let's start with the pros of the game, of course everyone has different opinions so some things I like a lot, others might think is no big deal. First, as of now there is no Auction House, which I deeply enjoy because it makes trading a much more personal, and organic feeling, to actually have to look for someone selling/buying something makes you really feel like your trading unlike dumping stacks of items into an AH and waiting for someone to buy it and automatically receive gold. I enjoy the 'class' system, as in there really are no classes, there are multiple talent trees including your three classic archtypes; ranger, warrior, and mage, followed by assassin, prophet, and templar. You are free to spend your points wherever you choose, thus making it really feel like you're building your own unique class. Attribute points are much the same, you get 6 attribute points every time you level in which you are free to spend between 6 attributes; vitality, energy, focus, ranged, sorcery, and melee. Allowing you to make countless combinations with this system. The thing I like the most about the game is the limited number of skills you can use. Often times in most MMOs, such as World of Warcraft I find that I have about 10,000 abilities, and about 9,950 do the same exact thing, or slightly off of another ability. With so many abilities I find myself constantly watching over my action bars and never focusing on the actual game, then I question myself 'Why am I playing a game where all I do is watch little squares fill up again and glow so then I can click and watch them again?' It feels like I'm ochestrating a Beethoven piano masterpiece. However, in Eldevin it's much, much different I can go through a dungeon using only 3-4 abilities and focus more on the game and the environment rather than just my action bar managing cooldowns, that being said however, the combat is very basic, standstill and attack combat. Now, onto the cons, before I start however, I know that Eldevin is NOT a Triple A, mainstream production and that it is an indie f2p MMO, therefor there is some room for slack. Right off the bat I noticed how rough the human animations are, your arms stand straight to your sides and when you run it isn't much better. I specifically say human animations, because not all the animations are bad, which blows my mind, because as you progress through the game you'll encounter various style of spiders, and I'd say the spider animations are about 99% legit, their legs move realistically, almost to the point where it's scary. With that being said, I don't understand why your own character is so rough when there's spiders out there that are 10x better. Eldevin is able to be controlled using a classic WASD system, however it is also point-to-click, much like Runescape. This offers a different, unique style of movement not offered by other MMOs, it can also be a nuisance as well, often times the path finding is clunky and your cameras and character will flip out and run in different directions, or as a mage or ranger you'll go to begin to attack a target from a range, and instead of getting into line of sight and attacking, you'll run straight up into the mobs face and then start attacking, little things like this bother me, and in my opinion it'd be better off without point-to-click movement in total. I have to admit, I did have quite a bit of fun leveling in this game, the max level is 45, and it took me roughly 5-6 days to reach it, playing pretty regularly, the quests are your typical generic MMO quests, but occasionally you'll get a long story line that removes you from that 'Collect 10 Boar Flanks' 'Grab 12 Bags of Flour' ditch that drags on. The Story lines are decent enough and long enough to provide you with a break from all the grinding as you unsolve mysteries like who assassinated a mage without the Arcane Sanctum, or freeing a brigade of Eldevin soldiers from the Void. Besides the story lines, the questing is nothing substantial and you'll be glad to reach level 45. The dungeons are much the same as the quests, just grinds. There is Story Mode dungeons which are soloable, (farmable) and Dungeon Mode dungeons which are undoable for the most part due to the low population of the game, average queues are between 1hr-2hrs on most days for most dungeons, so for the most part you'll be soloing Story Mode dungeons. The bosses in the dungeon are nothing short of spectacular, 90% of them are basic Tank n' Spank fights with AoEs to avoid, nothing ground breaking, and nothing challenging. The biggest problem with the game, and you sort of can't blame the game, but then again if the game was more popular it wouldn't have the problem, is it's low population, you'll see the same people online all day, every day. You'll group with the same people, trade with the same people, and talk with the same people. Which isn't too much of a problem, because you'll just get to know them and befriend them, or dislike them and have bitter rivalries, but it would just be nicer to have a larger population, but I guess every game wants that right? The low population calls for many problems though such as; the limited amount of max level crafters/gatherers, you'll have to wait for them to come online, they're celebrities. The endless dungeon queues, and facing the same people over, and over in PvP, which leads to a major problem. Only the same people PvP in Eldevin, so if you are new to level 45 and undergeared I hightly recommend you DON'T attempt PvP or you'll just be slaughtered in seconds by the top geared members of Eldevin. PvP revolves entirely around gear seeing that the combat is so basic, it's much like the Revolutionary War, lining up across from each other and shooting face to face until the other drops, whoever has the better stats is going to win the spam fireball at each others face game, so PvP loses its appeal to me in this game just for the sheer lack of fun, it's either spam fireball someone less geared than I am, or get spam fireballed by someone more geared than I am. Being 45 in Eldevin in total lacks much fun, it's like growing up, when you are a kid you get to have all the fun, then you become an adult and the serious business starts, likewise is that to the levels in Eldevin, as soon as you hit 45, if you are to compete with other 45's you will need to grind the same dungeon for hours, for weeks, to get the gear, never making you feel accomplished because all you did was spam fireball on some spiders for a week to get your gear. All in all it's a decent game, but it needs a lot of work, and a lot of content. It quickly loses its luster as you level. Eldevin isn't all that bad though, it really gives you a generic MMO feel, so its very good for first time MMO players to get the hang of them. It's extremely easy to learn and play, without spending hours watching tutorials or reading up on it. The biggest thing is that it's f2p, and you can't go wrong with that, the only thing you have to spend to play is your time. Therefor I can't 'Not Recommend' it, because you can lose anything. It's a good enough game to spend a couple weeks playing, and to revisit occasionally. \",\n",
       "  \"AdVenture Capitalist is a grindy addictive little game. It's very simple, but time consuming. If you are wondering why so many people have a lot of 'playtime'in this game its because you collect money while you have it running. It actually gives you money even when you are offline, but its nice to have it running so you can upgrade as soon as possible. This game is actually pretty flat. It doesnt give you much cool stuff, its always just a new grind to yet another unlock. Everytime you level up something it always doubles the amount of cash gain. It's still very addictive for some strange reason. I guess its because people in general just love unlocks and progression in a game, even if it doesnt do much. This is a free to play game, but doesnt force you to buy anything really. You can buy some things for real money if you wish, but I dont see a reason for doing so, unless you want some cosmetic things. Just let the game play itself and you will have lots of money to spend on new upgrades. This looks like it could be a mobile game, but it does not have any microtransation problem as these kinds of games on appstore normally have. Options are good and you can play in window mode with a lot of different resolution options. This game should be possible to run on most computers, and steam cloud is available, which I always appreciate since I own more then one gaming computer. Its a good game for being free. I dont know if its actually fun, but it sure is addicting. Try it out if you have some time to waste and you wanna feel like you're accomplishing something.\",\n",
       "  \"This this game. It's adorable, it's fun, it's interesting. Recettear is indeed an Item Shop's tale; you take on the mantle of your father's incredible debt as Recette, an earnest and sincere young girl who's eager to preserve the house in the name of her father and facillitate the alleviation of said debt by turning it into a nifty little item shop at the behest of an authentic loan shark Tear, the fairy representing the people Recette's adventurous father owes all her money to. To do so, she needs to sell items and make weekly payments while balancing other economic decisions, such as buying stock, and time itself is also a commodity. There're truly different faucets of gameplay to this wonderful gem: dungeon crawling and making dough (not literally, she isn't Alicia and thus doesn't work in a bakery. There is another guide for that kinda Time is important as it determines what you can do. You only have X amount of time to do things each day, and certain activities, like going to the pub (no the girl won't get drunk, don't even think about it) for some reason or another, or going dungeon crawling, or operating the shop, or going to the park; interactions with other characters will often happen in places that don't serve an obvious purpose. Operating the shop involves managing the general ambience, as well as determining item placement (window shoppers should be taken advantage of folks), and involves attracting customers to investigate your stock and then haggling with them to get a better price. People will come in and ask for things you have set out, as well as things you have in storage. They'll also try to sell things to you, in which case you haggle for a lower price. Don't be like me and confuse the two, resulting in a loss of product or blowing all your money on a soggy loaf of bread. Successfully haggling and other things improves your rank and what not, increasing your access to X benefit and Y item, etc. Haggling in and of itself is mostly intuitive; you'll quickly realize that different people, like in real life, are malleable to different degrees when negotiating price, and they'll let you know if the price you selected bothers them (or walk out flustered. And beware of the little girl, she's stingy). The items themselves come in a wide variety, from food to clothing to weapons and the expensive dish thingy I found that people ignore in favor of chocolate. Why chocolate? . It's a blast to run through a cave picking up all these weird things and assembling your flying circus of a collection at the store to reintroduce them to society via CAPITALISM HO! To get items, you can buy stock, but it's best to get it through dunegon crawling; over the course of the game, Recette will encounter various characters, many of whom will become available as dungeon buddies who will slaughter hordes of strange bouncing goopballs to get you chocolate (and a plethora of other items; there's some RNG thrown into the whole thing). You crawl the dungeon, hacking and slashing and using special abilities and picking up items and eventually finding doors to let you exit the dungeon, for if you succumb to the horrors within your ability to leave with all the nice loot you got is severely limited. Boss fights are interesting and fun and the integration of action adventure hack and slash combat with the rigors of running the weirdest store ever provide a unique and delightful game play experience that actually, despite being a mashup of entrepreneurship and super spelunking, works quite well and delivers something I haven't really been able to compare to anything else. TL;DR Adventure RPG with hack and slash mechanics, as well as business simulation. Loli kawaii shopkeeper and friends slay baddies to get goodies and sell them for $ to save the world her livelihood. Cute, fun, unique, I totally recommend this, it's a great experience for me, and hopefully it will be for you too ^_^\",\n",
       "  \"this is perhaps one of the best market games on steam, though ideally there are not very many comparable games. Here is the things i think about it. 1. has a very unique overall feeling to it, all about making money and makes a impressive display of humour. 2. very well designed. The creator put a lot of work into making this game look appealing. 3. impressive game mechanics, although the system is somewhat limited the spacing between money making is very well made and is effective at showing you how the whole system works. 4. incredibly fun to play, in other words the game ingages you to play it and almost always countinues to be very fun to play. 1. has a pay to win market. Even though it is completly non-needed to spend any money, it is a very limited market that only has a few shop items. I honestly think that the shop needs to be overhauled and expanded. Because the items have an only 'eh' appeal. 2. You can eventually over-play the game, in other words this game limits how much you can do with money. When you get to the later stages and reached the trillion cash levels you can literally overspend all your money, then you will have to wait a few days to get more money. I honestly wish that i could play this game more fully and not have to play it in 60 minute periods then have to wait a few days for the cash to build up. 3. Incourages you to spend money. The way to avoid over spending yourself is to buy stuff like an to the-future item that gives you an certain amount of days worth of profit. This is greedy and i honestly think that the creators shouldnt have used such tactics to make more money. Overall I have to say that this game is worth a try and i think that you will enjoy this experiance however limited the games market is and how many flaws are in-game. I have to say that this is a acceptable 7/10 and i recommend it\",\n",

       " 16: [\"Crazily addicting like crack, though I've never done crack but anywho (for real though hard to put I can't put my finger on what keeps pulling you back into this game, but it's like just one more match, just one crap it's hours later didn't mean to be on this more LOl to get to a more serious review though: Yes this game is fun and there's a lot more to it than first meets the eye. However, it IS A multiplayer team based (4 divers vs 2 sharks) PVP game to it's core so expect nothing else (meaning it's fast and furious team vs team gameplay). Sharks vs Divers on an epic scale, or Divers vs Sharks how ever you perfer (mostly shark player here ;P ). The one main and pretty much only game mode atm is Blood and Gold, but really it's all you need. As divers collect your treasure and take it to so he can bank it for you to use on your next respawn, that way you can upgrade your weapons and deployables, as you escort him to the end where he'll be yanked free from the jaws of those nasty sharks wanting to destroy him and you the divers. As sharks it's your job to rid your waters of those pesky gold grabbin divers and their robotic friend . As you munch down more divers you'll gain evolution points to use on your next respawn so you can be tankier, faster, stealthier, and more destructive as you grow in power. Each shark has it's own specialized skills, for example the hammerhead perfers smashing divers into everything for the fast kill, where a thresher loves to smack the crap outta the divers with his tail lash and nasty threshing, and the tiger shark loves to go all stealth for the sneak attack. No worries though as I said divers get a huge range of different gear to use, from a sonar buay to detect nearby sharks, to mines, to weapons upgrades and mods so you can use dual pistols or go full boar machine gun and even add bleeding or toxic to each round sent down lane at those nasty pesky sharks. This game is unique in many ways, and ever so addicting, however it has a high skill ceiling so don't expect to just pick it up and be the best from the get go (though some do have natural talent); a lot of players have put in countless hours to be as good as they are. The game is totally worth it, and has a good top lvl community. Yes every bunch has it's bad apples, but most of the top players will treat you with respect and you'll find are very friendly if you do and act the same to them. Game devs could use a little people skills, but they've put people in place to help with that. Game gets updated often (and often includes free stuff like new maps, new diver gear, new sharks, new skin drops and has many sales that keep the community going, one of which will probably be a big one coming up that will include community skins. If you've looked at this game and have been on the fence, just jump over it; you'll be surprised just how much there is to this game, but remember it's a multipayer team vs team kinda game so expect nothing else. GG- Good Game totally worth it and I'll see you under the Sea for some more GGs'.\",\n",
       "  \"Depth is an wonderful PC game bringing a whole new type of combat to the forefront making it a game that is both suspenseful and action packed. Pro’s: Easy to learn, good skill progression, really easy to run, well balanced, great longevity, and REALLY STINKIN’ FUN!!!! Con’s: 3 game modes, not enough maps, community is bad, only recommend buying if you have friends to play with, way too expensive to buy at standard price. Gameplay: Depth is a game that is notably easy to learn but hard to master. Playing as a shark sounds like it would be really difficult but it's actually really easy. Sharks handle just the same as the diver, so jumping from one to the other is extremely intuitive. Each of the 6 sharks has a distinct advantage over the previous one with different levels of durability, speed, and killing power. Playing as a diver is the easier of the two roles at the start, since the divers get a heartbeat variating from slow, medium to fast depending on how close the shark is. Gunplay is also a pleasant surprise considering the setting is in water. Guns and water don’t usually mix, but they sure do in this case. Bullets from guns also have water resistance so they move slower and don’t travel very far but have enough power so they don't feel weak, which makes the game actually playable for the sharks. Since all of the weapons are well balanced and require skill to use, the more powerful weapons are not always a go to because they are expensive and take time to collect the necessary cash in order to buy, but these expensive weapons are usually a one shot kill. But considering that, it doesn't become unfair for the shark fighting against the divers with the more powerful weapons as they are a single shot and then you have to reload. Game Modes: Only three? Yeah. Only three game modes, that's a pretty absurdly low number of game modes to choose from. But on the bright side, the three modes are really well done and present different difficulties to each type of player by presenting teamwork, survival, progress, competition, and FUN! First game type is Blood and Gold. Each side has 30 life tickets. Diver’s are to protect the automated submersible robot that collects treasure from designated points along a linear track, stopping at each of the points for about 1-2 minutes while the divers are to protect themselves and said robot, all while scavenging for miscellaneous treasure to collect more cash to buy more weapons and upgrades for weapons. Sharks meanwhile are to kill divers. Each kill results in 10 upgrade points to spend on evolutions like bleed damage, more protection and better stamina. The second gamemode is Megalodon. All players spawn in as divers and the first one to kill the roaming Megalodon becomes it. Whoever has the most kills at the end as the Megalodon wins. Last gamemode is Hide and Seek. Pretty simple. Divers hide, sharks seek. The Heartbeat is a huge tool for the divers in this mode as it adds a huge level of immersion and intensity to this simple gamemode, all the sharks have to go on is localizing the sound of the divers respirator and the distinct looking bubbles coming from the respirator. Community/Online Connectivity: Oh dear. This is where this game has one of its shortcomings and why I would only recommend purchasing this game if you have a minimum of 3 friends to play with. Depth’s community is pretty trash. If you are a “noob” at this game and just bought it, don’t bother jumping into a public server as the more seasoned players will absolutely destroy you. People also leave matches consistently making it hard to really enjoy playing on public lobbies. Depth has very good connectivity with very good netcode so there isn’t any rubber-banding or lag at all, and its servers are really stable other than a few times where my friends would jump into a private hide and seek server and it would change it to a blood and gold game mode. But other than a few weird moments like that, it was solid. Looks: This game looks fantastic. Blur effects with being in the water limiting visual distance are on point adding to the suspense and realism. Lighting in this game is a huge deal, as a diver you get to experience the bigger contrast in how light or dark the scenery is by the level of light fading as you dive deeper, also adding to the immersion. I would say the only real complaint I have with this game’s aesthetics is the ambient wildlife such as the fish, as they look more akin to plastic replicas rather than real life fish. Also adding to that the pathing for the wildlife is incredibly basic, but gets the job done for a “fuller world”. Performance, Stability, and Options: Depth runs incredibly well, maintaining 60 frames per second even on lower end systems, unless you are running it on a potato laptop with integrated graphics. All thanks to how scalable this game is by the many options it has to offer. Price/Content: I’m sorry but Depth is not worth $25. Considering when there are only three game modes with not enough maps for 2 out of the 3 is practically criminal. Especially when there is 14 DLC packs for this game. each of these packs is $5-6, 10 of which are skin packs and 1 of the 2 “Character Packs” is a diver, which is just a skin because the divers don’t have stats differentiating themselves from one another. Hide and Seek only has 4 maps and Megalodon has 5, while Blood and Gold has 12 maps. Seems awfully unbalanced for only having three gamemode. Depth is just not worth $25 as the standard price. I would say its value for what you get is $10, not more, not less. Luckily this game does go on sale fairly frequently for around $10 which makes up for most of what I have just covered in this section. This was really the big problem for me when reviewing this game. Other Notes: Digital Confectioners needs to add custom server support, and REALLY need to add map creation tools for this game. Put these two things out and you are going to have a huge spike in overall player count. I can also think of two really cool game modes for Digital Confectioners to add. Shark Vs Shark, and Diver Vs Diver I suggest the titles to be “Blood Bath”, and “Water Wars” respectivel, because alliterations, and they would be so rad. I mean 3v3 sharks! That would be an insane game mode if implemented correctly. Final Conclusion: Depth is a wonderful game with a great implementation of underwater combat that is beautiful to look at, has intensity and suspense, and is incredible to play at lan parties. I love this game despite its bad community, lack of content, and its huge price tag. But when you sit down and play a few rounds with your friends, those problems fade away as you are having so much fun teasing your friends about how they can't find you in hide and seek, or how you are fighting in blood and gold down to the last life ticket, that’s when this game makes up for its shortcomings.\",\n",
       "  \"I love this game. Thats what I need to say first. Few game tips at the very end. Pros: Nice team balance (as in 4 divers vs. 2 sharks) It can run on low spec computers Nice level/skill system Some cool skins (which randomly drops at times) Can be beautiful with high spec computers. Nice thrill with the heart beats on the divers side. Divers only gets to see the sharks through walls only when the sharks bites/detected by flare/sonar. Divers being highlighted through walls for the shark side. Majority of the maps are good. There is a learning curve you have to go through. I guess the super smart AIs? You can jump out from the ocean to get the JAWS feels Cons: Matchmaking is horrible In depth review: Okay so this game is really worth buying but I feel like $20 is expensive a bit, so I recommend you to buy this game when its on sale. It is worth a buy! It is totally worth a buy, because you will enjoy the thrill the game gives you. Anyways, I'm gonna go through few of the pros and cons I've listed. First, good team balance. I say it's balanced because the sharks can kill divers really quick (depends on how fast the player thrashes, but you can still kill the divers easily unless you do not thrash at all). This does not mean the sharks are super OP hands down. The diver who has been caught is really helpless, so it depends on the other three divers. If two sharks caught two divers, then there are the other two that can help them out. Then wouldn't that mean the sharks busy eating would also be helpless? Well this matters on how you play as a shark. Yes, you are hopeless when you're in middle of divers with guns doing nothing but eating. No, you're not completely helpless if you hit and run. After biting, sharks need to run or else they can die. Now, the divers can choose to watch his mate helplessly die or to chase after the shark to help the diver out or at least avenge for the gonner. This game can be played without team work, but it will be definitely fun to have your friends to get some team work. In case if you are wondering with the highlighting and heart beat system, read this next two paragraph. If not, don't read it. I want to save your time. As a diver you have this heart beat system. As you can already guess, when the sharks comes closer your heart beat increases to warn you. But you do not know the sharks exact location. They can be right by the corner, they be on the opposite side of the wall, they can be right above you. You do actually get to know their exact location if they bite one of the divers, be detected by flares, or by being detected by sonar buoys. As a shark, if you come closer to the divers you can see them highlighted through walls or even without walls. This helps the shark side so much because if there wasn't any system like this, I tell you, the divers immediately becomes a stealth squad and you would ask yourself a question which is suppose to be the hunter and prey. Okay next. The team balance is excellent, but matchmaking is HORRIBLE. I had to make that in caps for these reasons. One, maybe because there aren't enough people playing this game, but man it can take more than 3 - 5 minutes to find a match. It could be possible that this is due to the game being underrated, poor servers, or whatever the reasons. Although, sometimes you can find a match ultra super hyper excellently fast. Sometimes, even you chose to be a shark or diver you get on the oppsite team of what you wished. This is probably because the game couldnt find enough players on one side. Secondly and lastly, you do not get to play with the player on your skill level. So yes you do meet with level 80's and 100's sometimes even though you're like level 1, 2, 20, doesn't matter. However think like this, the level does not actually tell how good they are. Skilled players are skilled and non-skilled are non-skilled, level does not matter. Some level 100s can be weaker than a 20, 30, whatever level. Seriously though, in this game level does not really matter it all depends on your skills. You can level up quickly in the beginning so you can unlock skills and items real quick. After you go through the learning curves its all about your skills. But yeah higher levels are more experienced so they are usually stronger. But think about it. This was probably a sacrifice the devs had to make due to the lack of population. If you feel like buying this game here are few tips for beginners: STICK TO DIVERS (its a robot where divers put all their treasures in) Sharks: Don't think about breaking because its just impossible unless your opponent is all clueless about the game. Don't leave the game just because your opponent is ultra fantasticoly super hyper nova strong. Don't leave because the seals dodge you in the perfect timing. Don't leave because you're gonna get a bot take over your place. Don't underestimate the bots because they are really smart. They've got aim hacks, wall hacks, and insta (not really) kill hacks. Here are some reasons why I nominated this game for awards: this game, first of all, does not have much attention even though its really great. Second, the price is not bad for what it provides. Now, you even have cool skins to play around with. Third, for a pvp game this is great. No toxic community, no salt, intense, fun to play solo and with friends, not super competetive, and fairly balanced pvp.\",\n",

       "  \"Depth is a first person multiplayer game pitting teams of divers against the infamous predator of the sea, the shark. Playing as divers sees you take on mutliple different sharks in often claustrophobic and submerged corridors or in dark, wide open spaces where your reflexes are the only thing that will keep you alive. As a shark you have one goal and one goal only, tear every last diver to shreds and prevent them from completing their objective. The game currently has two game modes and I'll briefly explain them now: First up we have 'Blood and Gold'. In 'Blood and Gold' four human divers must protect an underwater robot called while he travels around the map opening old safes to find loot. With the objective to kill the divers and stop we have two sharks, killing humans rewards the sharks with skill points which can be used to unlock skills making the sharks more powerful. In 'Blood and Gold' both teams have 30 respawn tickets, the sharks win if the humans use all 30 respawn tickets and the humans win if the sharks lose all 30 respawn tickets or they safely get back to the dive boat with all the loot. This game mode focuses on close encounters in cramped rooms. The second game mode which was recently released in a free content update is called 'Megaladon Hunt'. In 'Megalodon Hunt' five divers take on the Megalodon, a far more powerful version of the Great White. The divers are tasked with killing the Megalodon and whoever gets the kill then becomes the Megalodon, divers can get better weapons by collecting treasure along the sea floor. The objective of the Megalodon is to stay alive and kill divers but with no health regeneration in this game mode this player must also hunt seals as they dart around the map which provide the Megalodon with more health. This game mode focuses on map-wide combat as the divers chase down the powerful shark. +Great graphics +Fantastically gory, if you manage to escape the shark after being in its jaws you're gonna be a bit torn up, literally +Following the content update on April 2nd there are now four playable sharks +A wide variety of weapons and consumables +The controls are fantastic, divers feel agile and graceful in the water and sharks really feel like they have some weight to them +Quite a few maps now that there have been some new ones released +The divers hear a heartbeat which increases in volume as the sharks get closer to warn them of impending danger but this also makes this very tense for the divers as they could be attacked any second +Sharks take divers in their jaw and must shake the mouse to kill them which provides the diver in question (using a knife) and the other divers a few seconds to kill the shark before they become chum +Very dark environments which make it hard for divers to see where sharks are coming from +The skills for sharks to unlock are fantastic and really add to the gameplay +The Devs have already posted two DLC-worthy content updates since the game's release adding more content +Has an editor mode and the Devs are fully supportive of modding in the game +Performs well +If you can't find anyone to play with you can practice against bots -Sharks are considerably more fun to play as, I found this led to me and my friends arguing a lot about who should play as the shark next -Unless you have friends to play with (as I do) you're gonna spend a lot of time waiting in lobbies as there aren't many people playing this and it relies entirely on matchmaking, there's no server browser Verdict: 9 This is easily one of the best multiplayer experiences available on Steam with great asymmetrical gameplay and all the gore you could hope for this is well worth full price as I paid for it.

       "  \"Given the rise of popularity of this smash indie-horror title, I felt I should do a review. Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie horror game where you play as Micheal Schmidt, a security guard who as him, basically try to survive against four animatronic animals trying to kill you. The catch? You don't move and you have a limited power supply, meaning you have to be conservative with your power or else Freddy the Fazbear, the titular character of the game, will come and murder you. Five Nights at Freddy's pits you in a broken down (I call it that because of how decrepid a lot of things look in the game) pizzareia that hosts a number of animatronic anthromorphic animals (like you would see in Chuck E. Cheese), most infamously Foxy the Pirate himself. Each animatronic has their own meaning that they do NOT act similar and will try to use their own methods of killing you. You, the player are left to utilize a set cameras set around the place, a set of doors that go down in an emergency (when Bonnie or Chica are right outside your door) and door lights for when you have NO idea where they are on the cams. As the nights progress, the animatronics will become more and more aggressive, with more frequent attacks, and sometimes they will linger outside your doors for longer periods of time. Though it's on Night 4 when Freddy himself becomes a bit of an issue himself, as he can litterally sneak in while you check the cams and gives absolutely NO warning when he's in the room, making his jumpscare all the more startling. Though for newcomers for the game, there is a sort of guide in-game to help, through a series of phone calls left over by the previous security guard. These phone calls give you helpful hints as to being able to survive the nights (such as checking on Pirate Cove periodically, making use of door lights and playing dead if the power goes out). While Five Nights at Freddy's isn't exactly scary, it's more nerving wracking and paranoia-building, making you panic when Bonnie, Chica or even Freddy can't be found on the cameras, and that actually makes the game arguably even more terrifying. Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a good horror game that brought new ideas to the table and made them work, though the game is a bit short. Five Nights at Freddy's gets 7/10\",\n",

What do you have to survive? Animatronics, yes, animatronics. The four main animatronics are Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy who all have different attack patterns; different ways to get to YOU. Here are some things that Five Nights at Freddy's does well: Making the player feel challenged: Five Nights at Freddy's starts out very easy but then ramps up the difficulty, especially in the later nights. Making the player feel helpless: Now, it goes without saying that if you were stuck in a place with 4 killer robot furries, you'd feel pretty helpless. And sense you're in a tiny office just waiting for you to get stuffed into a suit, it amplifies it. Fear: Five Nights at Freddy's will obviously be scary, right? Yes, it is scary. If you fail to stay alive through a night, you will be killed by one of the robots in 'A cheap jumpscare? Really?' you might ask.

       " 22: [\"The basic game design is fun, more's the pity because it's sunk by several flaws and mind boggling design decisions. So the AI is terrible, which would be fine, because it's meant to be a tabletop game. The kind you pull out and play with your friends on a Friday night, but unless you have a ton of friends who own the game you will be playing with you can't talk the designers think that if they implement in game chat it would need to be moderated. So great, playing a table top with tons of strangers that I can't even talk to, besides saying one of about 12 preset phrases. Theoretically, you can get around this by adding people as your steam freinds, but if you want to carry on a converstation you will have to alt-tab out of the game constantly to use steam chat. Imagine having to put your tabletop game back into it's box every time you want to say something other than one of the 12 things the game developers thought of for you. To make a titanically poor decision even worse, the responses are 'personalized' to the characters, so something like 'well played' or *laughs* can come off kind of snarky depending on who you're using. Think one of the other players in the game is nice, or skilled or fun to play with despite the fact that you can barely communicate with them? Well, hope you memorized their name and they know who you are, because there's no in game friend requesting. So basically you have the choice between playing with the mind-numblingly bad AI or waiting 5 minuites for your turn to come around while playing with a much more intellegent human, who serves as a proxy for a better AI because you can't really interact with them. If that's not enough to put you in a straight jacket, the game ends with a summary of your accomplishments using cute little badges for things you accomplished in game. 'What things?' You might ask. Nobody knows; they aren't described anywhere inside the game or any of it's accompanying material, but since they are just for bragging rights, and there's no bragging (due to the lack of a chat function and the fact that when you finish you get dumped into the lobby with a new batch of strangers) I guess it kind of makes a perverse sort of sense, it just makes me completely indifferent to earning these things, since I have no idea what they are. To be fair you can kind of guess at some of them, but others are completely opaque, still with no background it's never like, 'Wow so and so captured 8 cities!' it's more like, 'We all captured cities but so and so edged us out maybe, I can't really tell here, but it kind of sounds like it. He might as well be an ultra slow AI and I'll never see him again anyway, so I guess it doesn't The final critique I have of the game is that the king will mostly die on his own before you can fight him. This makes the ending extremely anticlimatic. Even if it ends in a battle, it will be more like an epic hero bulling a 1-3 hp enemy. I wish you could turn off the constant life drain, at least in the house rules, but alas another opportunity missed. Sadly, Armello is a solid game with good mechanics and a clever use of the digital board game format. If I was sitting in the development studio working out the bugs, or playing in a focus group with three other people I would be having a blast, but sitting in my room throwing canned responses into the ether or alt tabbing out and slowing the game down for everyone so I can carry on a conversation completley kills the fun. It feels kind of like playing Settlers of Catan with a house rule that anyone who speaks has to discard all their sheep.\",\n",

       "  \"AI War: Fleet Command (AIW), is an Asymmetrical 4X Tower Defense RTS. Which I know probably sounds very jumbled up so let me break that down a little more. Asymmetrical: While you are playing AI Wars, the computer is playing something more akin to Risk. 4X: Pretty self explainatory it follows the 'eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate' style of gameplay. Tower Defense: This is the one that threw me off it at first because I generally don't enjoy TD games, however, in AIW it is more a the defensive side of the game, in that you have a whole arsenal of turrets at your disposal to defend your planets with, while your RTS fleet is off doing offense. They are more akin to towers, and turrets from a traditional RTS like Starcraft or Warcraft. RTS: It is a real time strategy, with a grand campaign feel for it. You have your more 'tactical' fighting at the planet level where you might be maneuvering your fleet to best deal with the AI, but on the Galaxy map that planet is only one of 80 in a normal size game (You can go as little as 10 planets, or as high as 120 I believe) Story: The war for humanity is over, we the AI has all but wiped humans off the face of the galaxy leaving only pockets left in the abyss before turning their attention to more pressing concerns. You play as one of those pockets, and using the AI's absent mindedness to begin rebuilding the human race, and take revenge. Assuming you can be sneaky enough to not draw the full ire of the AI before your plans go off. Personal Take: I've dumped well over 100+ hours into this game over the time I've had it, which is a huge amount for me, however, a drop in the bucket to many of it's fans. This is a game where you start with 1 planet that you call home, everything else is owned by the AI (technically it is two AI, but they are a team). As such you have to be very strategic about how you move forward. If you just kill everything around you, you end up drawing attention to yourself in the form of AI Progress, which in turn causes the AI to send bigger, and stronger attacks against you. If you're playing anywhere near your skill level in the game, that can mean disaster for you. It's very much a game of learning how to push to what you need without necessarily steamrolling everything. The AI in the game is phenomenal, and hands down the best computer AI I've ever seen in any sort of RTS/Strategy game. It does have it's downsides though as the biggest being that there is a pretty steep learning curve for the game. The tutorials do an excellent job teaching you the different aspects and controls of the game, but it is a lot to take in, even with just the base game and no extra fluff turned on. (It's grown a fair bit in the 7 years it has been out). It's other drawback is that it is a hard game, a very hard game. This is mostly by design, as remember we've already lost the war, when you start the game, the AI already has 10k+ ships floating around in the galaxy and getting more as you play. There is a joke among the hardcore players (the 5-6k+ hours played folks) that winning on 10/10 (the hardest difficulty) is a bug, which it normally is. The developers for this game have spent the last 7 years essentially playing a PVP game against their player base of seeing how they exploit various AI missteps at 10/10 and then fixing those with the help of the players. There is a demo on Steam if you want to get your feet wet first. (I love games that provide Demos) If you do enjoy it, or have enjoyed it in the past they announced a few days back that they are making a new one, and are currently running a kickstarter for it if you are interested. They are adding a bunch of new things to it, but the one I'm most looking forward to is the 3D graphics, and re-designed UI.\",\n",

Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, 'A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? So I figure this way I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next Younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld have credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of the genre of standup comedy, but also as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television. Seinfeld said of Cosby: 'He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote 'comic' and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see Comedian Larry Wilmore also saw a connection between Cosby's standup, in the concert film Bill Cosby: Himself, and the later success of the The Cosby Show, saying: 'It's clear that the concert is the template for The Cosby Cosby remains an actively touring stand-up comedian, performing at theaters throughout the United States.

At the beginning of the 1965 season, four stations declined the show; they were in Georgia, Florida, and Viewers were taken with the show's exotic locales and the authentic chemistry between the stars, and it became one of the ratings hits of that television season. I Spy finished among the twenty most-watched shows that year, and Cosby would be honored with three consecutive Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama When accepting his third Emmy for the show, Cosby told the audience: “Let the message be known to bigots and racists that they don’t count!”[19] \"],\n",

       " 28: [\"The single player experience is a little short, clocking in at around 6 hours for me. However, everything else about this game is thoroughly enjoyable. I play games on GNU/Linux exclusively and the performance for this game on my OS is great. The art direction is top notch, as in the last two games. Everything about this entry feels like a worthy addition to the Trine franchise. There are some things different in this game, most notably the lack of skill progression. I know former Trine fans might really miss that, but honestly I felt rather ambivalent about it myself. I does it really make much sense anymore anyways? For me, I love Trine for its light-hearted storybook-style fairy tale setting and story. It actually kind of bugged me that if you played the first Trine you started off in Trine 2 without some of the skills you gained in the first one, and some don't even exist in Trine 2 that existed in the first Trine. Likewise when people complain that Amadeus can no longer conjure more than 1 box at a time in Trine 3, I have only to remind everyone about the lack of floating platforms in Trine 2, other player abilities, equipment in chests, etc. So, it's not without precedent. I actually think it's good to see Frozenbyte trying to stretch out and experiment. Accordingly, having the freedom to move along the Z axis in 3D is a great addition. At first I was skeptical and thought it might be too confusing or change up the core gameplay mechanic. But, how it's implemented is done really well. It's different enough to be interesting, but subtle enough to keep things familiar and intuitive. Really, the biggest thing for me (as I mentioned earlier) is the story, and Trine 3 presents something very intriguing that recontextualizes the two prior entries in the franchise. I don't want to give any spoilers away, but suffice it to say the game goes back to its roots and sets out to answer a question I hadn't really thought to ask before: what is the Trine in the first place? What is *its* origin? It's not just this new revelation either. The game also goes back to its roots in bringing back skeletons and other darker elements seen in the first Trine. I actually played Trine 2 first, so going back to the first Trine felt a bit disjointed at first, since the story seemed more epic and a little darker. Trine 3 manages to keep the light-hearted fun tone of Trine 2 while telling a story more on par with the first Trine. Sadly, it looks like the devs were shooting for a story scope that would fit the epic premise of Trine 3. I say sadly, because the game ends rather abruptly on a cliffhanger. Maybe in the future with a DLC or two the story presented can be properly finished. I know some players could look at this as some kind of money grab, since in the past with Trine 2 its DLC expansion was truly an expansion, with the original story relatively standing alone. But, y'know, even there there's precedent. Plenty of films have ended on cliffhangers, and $8 for a 2 hour film at the theatre is still more expensive than $22 for a 6 hour game--especially when said game also includes multiplayer. (Disclaimer: I actually only purchased the game while it was on sale here recently, but mainly that's because I was waiting to get the game once the Linux version exited Beta). All in all, I would definitely recommend getting this game if you like the Trine series. It's definitely different than the prior entries, but if you go into it with an open mind you might just be pleasantly surprised.\",\n",
       "  \"DO NOT BUY TRINE 3!!! I recommend you buy Trine 1 and Trine 2 instead. The developers ruined Trine 3 by shifting from a 2D to a 3D platformer. The 3D aspect of Trine 3 ruined the Trine franchise. They also remove the upgradable abilities for each hero which is a big mistake! Frozenbyte should've just stick with a 2D platform game like Trine 1 and Trine 2. If they made Trine 3 as a 2D platform game with features included in Trine 1 & 2, it will get positive reviews and sell well. Good thing I bought this during steam sale. *Note to Developers: If you're gonna make another Trine game make sure its a 2D platform game with all the features included in Trine 1 & Trine 2!!! If it ain't broken don't fix it! Then maybe you can add some new features like pickable gear & equipments for the three heroes. It will also help if you can create a better story with a serious tone.\",\n",
       "  'Just play Trine 1 and 2',\n",
       "  \"I'm not much of a reviewer, but after reading the response to Trine 3 I felt I should also put in my two cents. Because I really liked Trine 3. Despite being very different from the previous games in the series, Trine 3 still has the beauty and the soul I came to know and love. The gameplay has changed (pretty drastically), but that is not necessarily a bad thing. This is what I thought was positive, neutral, and negative; The positive: - The storytelling. Now, it is true that the story in Trine 3 has an open ending (which I agree with other reviewers is a negative point). However, the part of the story that is told is told magnificently. The story of Trine 3 tackles the origin of the Trine and the other artifacts of power. Personally, I was completely engaged by the story, much more so than I was by the stories of Trine and Trine 2. I really hope there will be another game to finish the tale. - Visuals. The Trine games are all beautiful, this one being no exception. Everything is as colorful and fairytaleish as ever. I particularly loved the extra detail poured into the appearance of the three heroes. With each installment they've become more recognizable, which I consider a big plus. The first Trine was about a Thief, a Wizard and a Knight. Trine 3 is about Zoya, Amadeus and Pontius. Also, one level (I believe level 6) takes places within the pages of a book - rarely have I seen any part of a game that beautiful. Wow. - The music. There's really not much to say about this; it's amazing. The soundtrack was made by the same person who made the soundtracks of Trine and Trine 2, and he has yet again failed to disappoint. - The single character levels. In the main storyline levels of Trine 3, you can play as all three characters, just like in the previous games. However, Trine 3 also features plenty of non-story levels in which you only control one character. There are a few level focusing only on combat (most of which you play as Pontius, but also one as Amadeus) and each character has two mini-levels focused around that character alone. Pontius was separated from his companions, and his two levels focus on him getting back to them. Zoya's levels detail her search for the giant emerald she was chasing at the beginning of the game, and Amadeus takes a nap and goes on a quest for the elusive fireball spell in his dreams. I thought these levels were really quirky and fun. The neutral: - The 3D. On one hand, it is a refreshing change from the first two Trine games. The extra dimension really adds to the puzzle aspects of the game, opening a whole new dimension (literally) of possibilities. On the other hand, the camera sometimes acts wonky and missing a platform and dying is very easy. The 3D is great for the puzzles, less great for the platforming. - The character's abilities. Like many other reviewers, I was sad to see the variety of hero-specific tools and powers diminished. Zoya no longer has any special arrows, Pontius has lost his hammer, and Amadeus can now only conjure one box at a time. However, there are some new abilities I really came to like. Zoya's rope (grappling hook) has become much more advanced. She can now tie both ends of the rope to two different objects, which is very helpful for solving puzzles. And, my favorite change, Amadeus is now actually useful in battle. I had tons of fun smashing boxes down on enemies, and he was actually my go-to combat character this time around. - Having to collect Trineangles (which were experience bottles in Trine and Trine 2) to unlock levels. As a collector and achievement hunter, I never even move on to another level until I'm sure I've collected everything in the previous level, but I can imagine other players being frustrated by this. If you do not have enough Trineangles to unlock the next level, you will have to replay a previous level to collect more. The Trineangles, however, are a lot less hard to find than experience bottles, so it should not take too long to collect enough. - There are a few minor bugs. Zoya glitches a bit when she has her bow drawn, sometimes you can phase though part of a wall, that sort of thing. I found nothing game-breaking, however, and the little bugs I found did not keep me from enjoying the game. I have read that there were some issues with multiplayer, but having only played solo, I cannot comment on them. Single player works like a charm, at least. The negative: - The lack of challenge. In the first Trine game, there were a few achievements that took some extra effort, like getting through a level without taking any damage. Trine 2 was achievement galore, and I spent many hours chasing the final hard and frustrating, but satisfying achievements. Trine 3, however, is already a fairly easy game, and there are no achievements which require you to do anything particularly special - just complete the game and collect everything. I finished the game (and collected all achievements) in about hours. Compared to Trine 2 (40 hours) and even the first Trine hours), that is very little time. This is not because the game itself is too much shorter than the first two games, but because there is no extra challenge. I would have loved to see some achievements requiring you to finish the game on a hard difficulty, or even some of the wacky achievements from the first two games that force you to go out of your way to do silly things like making an enemy sail on an improvised raft. - The ending. It's been said by many others, and I can only confirm it. The game ends in the middle of the story, which makes it seem unfinished. From the forum I've understood that the developers planned on this from the beginning, but failed to inform their fans. Now, I did not buy Trine 3 immediately after its release, so I had time to read the reviews before purchasing the game and I knew what to expect from the ending. However, I can imagine that those who did buy the game right off the bat were bitterly disappointed by the lack of proper ending. So, if you want to buy Trine 3, do be noted that the ending is completely open and the fate of the heroes is left ambiguous. - There is no leveling. While I was neutral on the characters' abilities being mixed up, I was disappointed by the fact that all abilities are unlocked for every character from the start. The reward of unlocking extra powers for characters (rather than the much more tedious task of having to collect things to unlock levels) is, I think, what made many players chase collectibles happily. Now the collecting has become a chore, as the awesome reward of new abilities has been replaced by the unlocking of levels - which I believe we are already entitled to, as we bought the game, and therefore doesn't feel like a reward at all. So, in conclusion, Trine 3 is indeed very different from Trine and Trine 2, and fans of the previous games are not by default guaranteed to like this one. However, in my opinion, different is not the same as worse in this case. Trine 3 is still a beautiful, quirky game with a lovely story, great characters and wonderful music. As long as you're aware that Trine 3 is not like its predecessors, the game is very enjoyable. I hope FrozenBite will be able to make another addition to the series to give us a satisfying conclusion to the heroes' journey.\",\n",

       " 31: [\" Influent is possibly best vocabulary memorising game (btw, i'd rather name it - App) I've ever played. For the language learning, Duolingo is a free app with multi languages for you to choose from, to learn some languages based on your native language. FYI: Just as what I said, Influent is designed for basic vocabulary memorising but not recommended for advanced language learners or those who keep many words in mind already. As a college student in language teaching major, I've been told that one of the best way to learn vocabulary or to have language learners memorize it is have the words integrated with animation or with graphic presentations, which can stimulate the learners' brain and improves efficiency, leaving them with less vocabulary lethe. That's how Influent works here. Hence if you're a starter in a language, Influent can definitely bring you tons of fun in learning it. Go get it and just get started.\",\n",
       "  \"The idea to learn language while doing something fun is great, It can't be like in this game. There is no actual goal (except for time attack mode). If it had some kind of quests, where you have to learn a word or a sentence to get further it would have been more useful. Like this - it's pointless. You just walk around and click on things. I believe it would be cheaper to get a simple old-school vocabulary. Or like I reemmber, when I was learning English there was a game for native English speaker to learn ther language. I mean for kids. It even had a story, a whole map and a bunch of playable characters. Gameplay was made of moving through map and solving different puzzles and or playing mini-games, where you had to find a correct word suiting the situation, make a sentence. Some games were simply for learning new words or even some grammar rules. Too bad I do not remember the name of the game =( Oh, and yes, I just played a fewminutes to realise, that this is NOT an educational material. So do not be alarmed by the 0hr stamp.\",\n",
       "  \"Influent is a language learning game in which you wander around a 3D, cartoony rendering of a small flat, identifying everything you see in a foreign language. The spatial aspect of the game is interesting and does help you remember nouns, and the timed trials to find a list of objects is pretty good as a challenge. However, the way adjectives and verbs are handled interesting. They're assigned to related nouns, in a way that spans from obviously good to downright confusing. I think maybe with a lot of practice this system might make a bit more sense but I never got there. The real killer for this as an educational application is that there is not nearly enough content. 300 words is not even remotely near enough - XKCD's famous Up Goer Five uses the top 1000 words, and you need about 3000 words to be able to put vaguely sane sounding sentences together. I can get that this isn't a full language learning application (there's no grammar at all) and that's fine. But considering all this does is teach you vocabulary, despite its other strengths, this game just doesn't teach you enough vocabulary to be useful. So despite the endearing art style, the slick Dustforce-esque soundtrack and the cool concept, this game needs an order of magnitude more content to be anywhere near worth its asking price (£7 last I checked). And remember, that's *just* for vocabulary. To pick an example to contrast, Duolingo does grammar, idiomatic usage, full text translation, pronunciation guidance *and* a much wider range of vocab, on a portable platform, for free. If you're intereseted in educational games, maybe have a look at this for an example of a slick product that partially succeeds, with ideas worth considering. But if you're actually trying to learn a language, this does far too little of just a narrow slice of what you need to be of significant use.\",\n",
       "  \"As a lover and learner of languages, i'm glad i found this little gem. Influent puts you in the shoes of an inventor whose invention has been ripped-off! Yeah, a language game with somewhat of a plot, i know 0_0. it's pretty unique though and a little bit of a quirky side story. The inventor states on his Fire-starter page that to prove this invention is his he will master 400 words in a foreign language. The game pretty much takes place in this guy's apartment and every item you click on teaches you the word in your language of choice. I was kindly gifted the Japanese version so for example if i click on the popsicles in the freezer the japanese characters or Romaji will show up (Japanese word for popsicles is aisukandi BTW :3 it's literally 'Ice Candy'). You can find a lot of different objects and in turn words all over the house. Collect 10 words to complete a set and then play a game where you search the house to match the words with the object. Do this enough times in the game and you will eventually master this word in-game! And i say in-game because whether or not you remember that word when you stop playing depends on your memory. This game is pretty ingenious when it comes to teaching a foreign langauge. It uses a memory training technique that involves creating a map in your mind and remembering where and what things are. I've never thought of doing that in terms of learning languages because i first learned Japanese watching anime. So i learned a lot of common Japanese phrases from watching anime. Anime also introduced me to a lot of other languages here and there. Kampfer introduced me to German, Croisse in a Forgein Labrinyth introduced me to French and Hetalia introduced me to almost every language ever 0_0. So i learned more from audio only for quite some time. Then when i could afford language books at Barnes and Noble i'd buy a book for whatever language i wanted to learn at the time. But books don't have audio and often don't have visuals. So good luck with Thankfully this game gives you both a visual and a voice to learn from. And from my experience with the Japanese language, the voice sounds like a real Japanese person saying the word. I even tested it on some words i already knew such as 'Hashi' (chopsticks) 'fraipan' (frying pan) and 'terebi' (TV). So far the words are totally accurate and i feel like i'm learning :D I even let my younger siblings play the game for a while and he picked up some words too, even messed around with the game's camera to look for words. Sadly, though i am learning quite a lot and having fun re-freshing my Japanese vocabulary the game is mostly just for Expanding your vocabulary and knowledge of WORDS. You won't be learning any helpful phrases or learn how to form sentences. The apartment of the inventor in this game can also start feeling claustrophobic at times because you'll end up running around the same 4 rooms looking for words to learn. I tried to open the door out of the apartment but it won't open. It's a shame because i want to learn more words. There's only so much that can help you expand your vocabulary when you're limited only the the apartment setting. And if the game were expanded and you could open the door to the outside of the apartment THERE'S THE POTENCIAL FOR LEARNING MORE WORDS! Like what's the Japanese word for 'resturaunt' or 'laundramat' or 'hospital'? THERE'S SO MUCH MORE POTENCIAL IF YOU COULD EXIT THE APARTMENT SETTING! And think about the potencial for mini-games! Instead of just 'Time Attack' you could enter a restruant and learn what specific dishes are called or try to order food in that language, or you could go to a hospital for a check up and learn phrases specific to that enviornment. That's the only bad thing i have to say about the game. If you could exit the apartment in the game there'd be so much more potencial and new words to discover. If not patching it into the game, i won't mind paying for it as DLC. It could be like an 'Around the Town' pack or something like that. So until that comes out, i will recommend this game but don't expect it to make you an expert at whatever language you want to learn. It will teach you some helpful words but no phrases and the setting can feel claustrophobic after a while. I give this game planes out of 5\",\n",
       "  \"I want to make it clear before I go on that I do recommend this game, but only as a supplement to other language learning avenues. This game is great for helping you memorize the common words for common objects you might find around a household. I was playing for only about an hour and I could already walk around the apartment and 100% a time attack challenge for my first vocab list in Swedish. However it's not going to teach you a language. It doesn't teach you sentence structure or grammar, it doesn't explain inflections or even usage in a pre-built sentence. This game is purely a game of memory. See an item, learn the word for that item, with no additional context. It would be excellent for a person trying to sharpen up their vocabulary recollection on a language they're already at least partially familiar with, but as a tool for teaching you a whole new language it's absolutely not an option. Clearly a lot of hard work has gone into this game and hopefully it continues to receive updates to make it more useful, broaden the scope of its teaching and address some issues with spelling in some of the other language packs. For now I think I need to go and find an actual teacher to learn this new language and at best I'll use this to help me along the way once I've already grasped the basics.\"],\n",

       "  \"It's rather daunting to speak about a legend like Braid. Many credit it as the reason the indie game Renaissance kicked off in the first place, and whether you believe that's a fair read or overreaching a bit, there's no question that Braid played a formidable role in the advancement of the indie game market, and the role of indie game as 'art film,' not 'demo Braid succeeded financially and critically. Braid opened people's eyes to the idea of the indie game as a form of expression, and the validity, and necessity, of games that don't follow a formula or sort neatly into a category. To call Braid merely a 'platformer' is to miss the point entirely. Most of what I'd like to say about Braid falls under the realm of spoilers -- it's a very hard game to talk about, without not only entering spoiler territory, but asserting one's own theories about what happens in it, what the player is seeing, what the events depicted in the game really mean. Braid is a game to be interpreted, to be meditated a game to be engaged with blind forward momentum. Speedrunning through Braid would be a terrible waste of the experience, at least until the game's events are well known to the player. Let me try to delicately walk the line of preserving Braid's many secrets, while sharing enough of the game to help demonstrate why it shines. From a mechanical perspective, Braid is a sidescrolling platformer. Your protagonist Tim runs, climbs, jumps and falls in a manner immediately familiar to the player. Upon his first death, however, we learn that we have the power to reverse time, and by holding down a key, rewind the game back to the point of decision and try again. We can do this as often as we like, reverse every mistake made, every mistimed jump, every unsuccessful stab at a puzzle, if we wish. Indeed, the game makes clear that this is not only our power as player, but Tim's own power, and that he's done this, over and over, in his own life. The puzzles encountered begin to incorporate Tim's power, requiring one to play with the flow of time to solve them, at this point. The puzzles are clever and fun, and finally figuring them out is quite rewarding, but they are, like the puzzles of Thomas Was Alone, merely a macguffin to draw the player into Tim's world, into his head, and into his way of thinking. The game is a philosophical reflection upon what it means to be Tim, to have this power, and to look at the world the way he does. Braid engaged by its mechanics is a clever and interesting experience, but Braid engaged in the context of its meaning, of what it might be saying 'between the lines' -- that's what makes it a must-have game. Enter Braid with the idea that the game is just an excuse to have a very interesting conversation with its creator about human agency, mistakes, regret, and the nature of interpersonal relationships. Be ready for the game to throw you some ferocious curveballs, and for you not to be satisfied with its story as a story in itself -- rather, for the story to be a vehicle that brings you to a new vantage point, from which to examine your own ideas of human agency, cause, effect, and meaning. Braid left me with a head full of thoughts about the way memory fails us, and the places in which wishful thinking seeps into the jars of our memories we thought were watertight, and spoils the things we imagined were well-preserved forever. It asks us, at the beginning, to imagine a world in which forgiveness is absolute, where mistakes can be erased, leaving no mark upon the future. Trial with ever-mitigatable, never lasting error sounds the game will, eventually, force you to confront the consequences of such a world, and to the temptation to mistake uncomfortable truths and reality for Surprising narrative power, for a cartoonish platformer with liberal nods back to the Super Mario Brothers franchise. If you're looking for a clever platform-puzzle game, Braid will fit the you'll be missing so much of what makes it special to engage it simply as a platform-puzzle game. Braid is a story, an inner journey, into the meaning of human agency, of love, loss, mistakes, lessons learned, and the nature of why time and causality work the way they do, told through a deceptively simple run-and-jump game with unlimited continues. If you're the sort who wants the game to applaud and cheer you for winning, you're exactly the sort of person Braid wants to you're going to be disappointed, in the end. That's okay. Weather the disappointment. Braid is talking to you; let it speak. Embrace your own discomfort with the things Braid has to say. Listen, and stop rewinding time to see if it'll say what you want to hear. Its message is not a 'mistake' to be \",\n",

       "  \"On the surface, Braid is a simple puzzle platformer. The gameplay, at its most basic level, consists of jumping on platforms and collecting puzzle pieces before moving to the next world. A couple of things set Braid apart and make it a fantastic experience. The first is the visuals. Everything in Braid is hand drawn, and it's quite a pleasure to progress through the game and see the different landscapes. Second; the puzzles. The puzzles in the latter stages of the game are, to say the least, mind-bending. You will have difficulty getting through Braid without a walkthrough for at least a couple of levels. Braid is best played in short burts; play for too long and the harder puzzles get frustrating. The puzzles themselves are brilliantly designed and are very satisfying to solve. The main gimmick of Braid is the ability to manipulate (reverse) time. It adds another dimension to puzzle solving and forces you to think about puzzles in abstract ways. Truthfully, Braid isn't for everyone, but it offers a unique gameplay experience for the puzzler fan.\"],\n",

       " 37: [\"Coming from the people who brought you the Driver and Destruction Derby series, at least before they were absorbed by Ubisoft, Reflections brings us this small Unity engine release Grow Home, a physics based platformer where you control a robot named and must grow a small plant large enough to reach your home ship. Gameplay is really intuitive, left and right triggers on the controller control your left and right arms, when you are near any surface you will latch onto it, allowing you to easily climb, all you must do is grab hold of branches of the Star Plant, named Star Shoots, and grow them into surrounding platforms, causing main plant to grow from the energy inside and get closer to your ship, which all seems quite easy and it is, the game never really becomes difficult or frustrating. Along the way you will pick up crystals that give you power-ups such as a jet pack to help you get a bit of a boost, and you can find plants to help slow your fall or glide along the sky, making it really easy to get around and even save yourself if you accidentally physics yourself off a platform. Overall Grow Home doesn't really have a whole lot going for it in terms of content, I got all the achievements and finished the game in just under five hours, but for those five hours I was greatly entertained, the climbing feels natural and fun, there are many caves to explore and things to collect, and the art style of the game feels like candy for the eyes, overall I recommend this game wholeheartedly for anyone looking to lose themselves in a fun little platformer for a while.\",\n",
       "  'Well, what to say about Grow Home? In Grow Home you play as BUD (Botanical Utility Droid), a robot on a mission to save his home planet by harvesting the seeds of a giant alien plant, thats basically your main goal, you make the plant grow, to go to other islands and get cristals, which give you more abilities and you keep growing the plant untill you reach the space ship. Its a fun game, i really enjoyed it, i hope it gets an DLC or a sequel in the future :) I totally recommend this game :) 10/10',\n",
       "  \"Grow Home is a fun game about a robot trying to grow a plant to the sky for research of the planet's resources? The game never tells you why you are growing the plant or anything, but it doesn't matter. Gameplay consists of climbing, Hunting for crystals, walking, climbing, and growing the plant by riding 'star shoots' or the attachments, into floating islands to claim nutrients for your plant to grow. I recommend this game if you can find it for a cheap price. My only complaints: -No music (minor) -Annoying if you fall of while doing something, resulting in a waste of time -Very very short I didn't like Grow Home at first, but it started to 'grow' on me. 8/10. Don't expect to get over 15 hours in this try it otherwise!\",\n",
       "  '*Skip to the bottom of the review for Tl:dr* Grow home is a charming platformer from Reflections, a Ubisoft Studio. Released on Steam in February, it was received to high praise almost unanimously. I gave it a download this weekend, and now feel compelled to talk about the charming platformer. Grow Home reminded me of Wall-E. You play as a lonely droid, BUD (Botanical Utility Droid), and MOM (missed what that stands for) drops you down onto a new planet. Your task is now to explore the planet’s biosphere and climb your way back to the mother ship by growing the star plant. The world centres around a large plant which has off-shoots with red flowers. By climbing up onto these you can make them grow, extending the size and reach of the main plant. Spread around the world are floating land masses, some of which have glowing green bottoms. These provide power, and it’s your task to grow the off-shoots into these to receive their power. Doing this X times will cause the main plant to grow another stage, moving you ever-closer to the mothership. It’s a simple premise, which could feel repetitive if not done correctly, but the charm of the world and novel controls negate that. The character controls somewhat like a ragdoll; it’s very reminiscent I Am Bread. You control each arm of the character with a different trigger, and direct him with the analogue stick. It feels great when you get into a nice rhythm, working your way up towards the mothership, but it does have a minor camera issue. For the most part the camera works great, but I did find myself sometimes babysitting it as the structure around me grew more complex. The game recommends using the gamepad, and I listened, so all my comments should be disregarded for keyboard controls as I’m sure it feels very different. At various heights throughout the level there are teleporters to be found. These allow you fast-travel between land masses at different heights. There’s also no punishment for dying. BUD dies from substantial fall damage, however if you do so you’re simply returned to the last teleporter you used. These two things mean there’s no punishment for exploring and taking risks. If you want to attempt a crazy jump between branches you can. If you don’t make it you can try again. I love this about the game. It encourages exploration and doing crazy things, ready for when you make mistakes. The main objective of the game is to grow the main plant and reach the mothership, but there’s lots to do in the world around you besides that. Throughout the world there are a number animals and plants to be found, some that require a lot of exploration to find! A running task is to find them all and bring them to a teleporter so MOM can scan them. Doing so will net you a new skin for BUD; there are other skins that can be unlocked by completing other tasks. There are also 100 crystals spread through the level. Some of these are really hard to find, and I found ~85 before resorting to a guide! Collecting these will unlock updates to BUD, giving you greater control over his movement. For example, when you reach around 60 crystals, you unlock a jetpack that gives you significantly more movement control. One of the main things I love about Grow Home is the environment itself. Low poly isn’t for everyone, but, when done right, minimalistic environment just look amazing. If ever I’d want to show somewhat what low poly should look like I’d point them towards Grow Home. It has so much charm and whimsy with the bright simple colours and shapes. Pair that with the underlying ambient soundtrack and it’s just an awesome environment. I do feel though that the relationship the player has with BUD could be greater. He is a cute little robot, but it doesn’t really go deeper than that. Like I mentioned earlier, it reminds me strongly of Wall-E, but you feel a lot more for Wall-E; you are always really routing for him. I didn’t feel that with BUD. He was merely a tool, a cute one, but nonetheless a tool in which I moved around the environment. I felt really warm and in-touch with the environment, but no so much BUD. Tl:dr – Grow Home is a charming platformer, with quirky controls and lovable protagonist. While short, and not without its minor issues such as camera control, its price and charisma overshadow these minor shortcomings to provide a wonderfully whimsical experience.

       "  'I’ve spent some time getting to know Grow Home, and I have to say – it’s an odd game. You play the role of a robot; some kind of representative of a space-faring species, dispatched to this garden planet to encourage the growth of a special plant. To do this, you’ll need to climb. A lot. the android (Botanical Utility Droid) has the ability to climb anything he can get his claws onto. In fact, this represents the vast majority of the gameplay. You climb plants, rocks, giant mushrooms; anything with a vertical surface on it, Bud will climb it. Once you start climbing the giant plant, you discover certain tendrils protruding from its sides. These tendrils can be made to grow like tentacles out from the plant and into special glowing rock formations. Each set of tendrils that are connected to these glowing rocks will make the plant grow taller. Eventually, I assume Bud will finally grow the plant high enough to reach his people’s orbiting space ship and go home. Along the way, Bud can find hidden energy crystals which upgrade his abilities and unlock new ones. These are fairly easy to spot, but climbing to them can be a bit of a challenge. I played long enough to ‘grow’ the plant twice. This took about an hour. It looks like I might have been about ten percent through the game at that point, so there’s a good 8-10 hours of gameplay here. What I liked – the graphics are very well done. They’re cute without being overly so, and definitely convey a sense of vertigo-inducing height. What I didn’t like – the climbing gameplay mechanic, the very core of the game, is clumsy. I have a feeling it’s supposed to be; it conveys a sense of haphazardness in Bud’s construction. However, when you’re about to fall to your death 30 stories up, the cuteness of the halfway working robot wears off quickly. I imagine that after playing for several hours, you might get used to the control scheme. It’s a cute game. If you like platformers that can give you nightmares about falling, this game is for you.

       " 40: [\"Give me a moment here, I want to make sure I don't miss any of these. Ahem: • WINNER: Indiecade Game Design, 2013 • WINNER: IGF | GDC Nuovo Award, 2011 • WINNER: Eurogamer Expo, RPS Indie Game of the Show, 2010 • WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Excellence in Design, 2010 • WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Bloodsport of the Year: 2010 • FINALIST: IGF | GDG Excellence in Design, 2011 • FINALIST: IGF | GDC Grand Prize, 2011 Those are the nominations and awards the newly released indie fighter, Nidhogg has listed on their home page. It was enough to make me pick it up without hesitation. I don't often define the quality of a video game by how many awards it's won, but when I start losing the ability to count them on my hands, apparently I do. A good thing, too. Nidhogg is all kinds of awesome. A DUEL TO THE DEATH The concept is remarkably simple: 2 players go head-to-head in a half duel/half race to the death, both equipped with fencing swords and capable of more than a few tricks to give an edge in battle. You begin facing your opponent in the 'middle' of a map, with an opening battle. Battles are fast and furious beyond imagining, often ending within a few seconds, which ties into the gameplay mechanic wonderfully: upon killing your opponent they'll need to wait a moment to respawn, allowing you to press forward toward your 'goal'. Win a battle and you're given the 'goal light' allowing you to move forward further; lose, and your opponent gains it instead. So long as you maintain the previous kill you can pass-by your opponent without engaging and edge closer to your goal - should they fail to stop your approach. This 'tug-o-war' mechanic is the single most endearing indie game element I've felt in a while. It's relentless, and the feeling of achievement after finally managing to push an opponent back to the end, before summarily being eaten by Nidhogg, is one of much glory and admiration. Simple, sure. But so very, very rewarding. Easy to learn, too, and likely near-impossible to master. MATCH MADE IN HELL Single-Player Mode consists of fighting steadily more challenging opponents, one after another, on one of 4 maps. So, naturally, if you want to be playing Nidhogg for more than a few hours, you're going to need to go multiplayer. Sadly, the online matchmaking within Steam isn't great. Assuming you can actually find a game, there's a good chance one of you will be lagging horribly — and when you're playing the type of game that you can't play with even the slightest amount of lag, matches can often lead to aggravating experiences. Assuming you have a few friends playing, and you're all within the same global region, this won't be a huge problem. And if you're lucky enough to have more than a few friends playing, then Tournament Mode will likely give you the greatest experience of all. I know, personally, playing live on Twitch, that this feature will make for 99% of all my time playing. WORTH A BUY? At $15~ I can only recommend a purchase here for players with friends planning to play with them - for now, at least. Which is largely a shame, as the gameplay offered in Nidhogg is truly exceptional. Possible improvements include visual upgrades to characters to simulate some form of character progression; as it stands, every game is the same and with 4 maps there's limited variety. You'll be relying on your opponents to entertain you; if they do, you're going to love Nidhogg, if not, you're likely going to get very bored, very quick.

       "  \"Nidhogg is a great multiplayer game, but it may likely only be worth it for you if you have a friend who can play it with you in person, the online is broken and nearly dead. The single player can help you learn the basics of combat, and can be a refreshing way to just fool around for a few minutes whenever you feel like it, but the meat of the game is in multiplayer, and right now the online feels dead and lags too much to enjoy consistant fair matches. Nidhogg's gameplay is fast paced, fair, and rewards creativity and skill. You will probably enjoy how the match goes too much to have hard feelings over winning or losing. Each match is played on one of 4 stages, each with 5 screens, one neutral screen and two screens for each player. Each player has an unlimited stock of lives, the goal isn't to kill your opponent but to reach the end of your opponent's last screen, killing them simply makes it harder for them to stop you. There is no skill floor or base APM that you need to meet to compete, no ganking or equipment advantage in Nidhogg, each player has only their foil and their wits as tools to reach their goal. Many times you may lose to an opponent only to find yourself learning a new technique or tactic to add to your toolbox, making playing against a more skilled opponent a much less daunting experience than in other games. Roping your friends in to play with you as your opponent doesn't feel like a chore or unreachable task if they have no knowledge base or skill in the genre, since they will pick up very quickly on the intuitive controls and learn how to play from simple observation. TLDR: Nidhogg is a game that feels perfectly easy to play and difficult to master, but at the same time avoids many problems of more hardcore dedicated multiplayer games that have the same strengths, and never comes off as unfair or unfun. If you have a friend to play against, or can nab Nidhogg in a sale I strongly recommend trying it. The game is bare bones, but the gameplay itself is fantastic and intuitive.\",\n",
       "  ' Ziggurat: Created by Milkstone Studios, Ziggurat is a first person shooter with rogue-like elements in which you play an apprentice wizard in training who must face the final test in order to become one of the brothers of Daedolon. That final test is the Ziggurat, a massive magic “dungeon” you must pass or die trying. First thing I’d like to share is that this game looks fantastic. There is so much color in this game! The style is quite different, I can’t quite put my finger on it but, it reminds me of Fable for some reason. All the environments, the lighting, spells and weapons you use have wonderful affects and the overall look of the game is amazing, I really love the graphics here in this game, it makes me wish there were more to see or an adventure to go on in this world. Usually I like to also include music with the overall style but here the music is average, it isn’t bad, just standard. The rogue-like elements in this game are the usual random rooms, weapons, enemies, loot, bosses and so forth. In fact the different types of rooms and the way they work reminds me a lot of the Binding of Isaac, some rooms will have you take a gamble in spending life or mana for potential gain or loss. Some will have treasure chest at the end of an Indiana Jones type room filled with either traps or a jumping puzzle in a room of lava. There is good variety here so traversing the Ziggurat shouldn’t feel too derivative. There is a lot to unlock in this game, however, you can actually beat the final boss in just an hour or two, the dungeons are pretty short so be expecting to go through multiple ziggurat runs to unlock everything. A sort of missed opportunity is having the final boss be something different or, adding more levels of the ziggurat every time you play through it so that each play through feels very different and to give more of a sense of progression. The games story is all frontloaded at the beginning cinematic and at the end of the Ziggurat, the game is entirely based on its combat. The combat is very reminiscent of games like the Unreal Tournament series or Quake Arena. The game relies on you to be fast and dodge all incoming projectiles, the more skillful you are in this the more successful you will be at the game. Weapons also lend to reminding me of Unreal Tournament, with all the weapons in the game having a main firing mode and an alternative firing mode, all this combined makes the combat feels very fast paced and chaotic, and pure fun. I really enjoyed myself with Ziggurat, its an amazing game for only USD. I hope this isn’t Milkstone Studios last game, I’d like to see Ziggurat get the Diablo 2 treatment, same world, similar style but completely cranked up, keeping the combat and adding in more role-playing elements and maybe a world to explore. I don’t say this often, this game is also great for kids, it isn’t overly easy or hard, its got great challenge, not super intense or gory, it’s just a solid gaming experience for all. TL/DR; Ziggurat is a solid first person rogue-like shooter, you play a wizard with bombs, spells, magic staffs and your trusty wand. Pass the trial of the Ziggurat or die trying. With beautiful graphics and good old fashioned, fast action combat you can’t go wrong dropping for this wonderful indie. I look forward to more games from Milkstone Studios. -Thumbs up from Royial Video Reviews can be found at: ',\n",

       "  \"Introduction Ziggurat is a rogue-lite first-person shooter dungeon RPG. You play one of several unlockable mages that fight their way through the mysterious Ziggurat, challenging each of its five floors or failing and meeting your doom. Each time you play, a different dungeon is generated with different enemies, different challenges, and different layouts. Gameplay You have four basic types of weapons. One is your standard wand, which is weak but has infinitely refilling uses. One is your 'spell' slot, which is usually a very powerful weapon you use on one enemy. One is a 'staff' weapon, that's weaker but works on groups of enemies. The last is an 'alchemical' weapon that's slow, strong, and hits groups of enemies. There are several different types for each of the nonstandard weapons, and you find them throughout the dungeon, depending on your luck. Everything in this game is projectile based, aside from a few melee-oriented enemies. Most enemies will shoot spells at you from across the room and you need to dodge them or knock them out of the air with your own spells. In larger rooms where more enemies spawn, you can end up in situations where if you stop moving, you'll be wiped out in seconds. If you've heard the phrase bullet hell, that fits this game at times. Another phrase that would fit this game perfectly is twitch shooter. Enemies spawn into a room over time. The more you kill, the faster they spawn. It's entirely possible for an enemy to spawn right behind you. If you don't respond quickly enough, they'll start damaging you. There are also enemies that lunge toward you, giving you almost no response time. I wouldn't call this game easy. Each floor throws new enemies and challenges at you and you have to be able to react and learn quickly to stay alive. It's pretty tough at times, and sometimes the RNG just decides to throw you nothing but curve balls. But I had a lot of fun playing it, and so did everyone I recommended it to. I will say that after enough time, you will start to see rooms that repeat. Either trap rooms that you've already beaten several tries ago or, more commonly, rooms that are just straight copies from one other. That's a common with all procedurally generated rogue-lites I've found, and I don't think less of it for that. In this game's defense, enemy spawns are still random even in rooms you've seen and fought in before. Story Not much to write home about here. Your character wants to join an elite order of mages, and the Ziggurat is the last challenge in the way. It claims the lives of hundreds of applicants, but more are always willing to charge headlong into it. You uncover scraps of lore as you play that give you more insight into how the Ziggurat works, but none of it really affects gameplay; it's all just for the lore. Graphics It has a very striking art design that makes it one of the prettier games I've played. When I showed it to a friend, he actually said it was beautiful. There are the occasional graphical glitches, like clipping through a small part of the wall, but that's usually hard to notice when you're jumping around the map, trying not to get it. With a single exception, all the enemies are designed to look differently. When they start spawning into a room, you'll quickly know what you're going to face and can begin planning and moving. From an enemy design standpoint, this game is golden. Once you clear a room, you have all the time in the world to look around. I would greatly encourage doing so, because the visuals in this game are amazing. From the walls to the floor to the open sky above you, everything about this game screams 'magic dungeon'. Some halls will be partially submerged in water, some will be covered in lava, some are full of winding staircases where enemies can attack you from all angles. If you decide to play the game, do yourself a favor and just look around after you're finished blasting everything. Play Time A lot of my skills from other shooters pulled through on me with this game. I managed to beat it in around six hours, after making several different attempts and unlocking many extra characters. If you like games where you can spend hours unlocking things and getting better gear, this game is right up your alley. There's also a score system, that judges you based on how long you took, how many kills and levels you earned, and a few other things. With that, you can compete with everyone else that played the game. I currently only have about nine hours into the game, but I could easily see myself putting in twenty. Not too long, but for a cheap indie game, I'd say it's pretty good. Final Recommendation I bought it during a steam sale and I absolutely don't regret it. The current $15 price tag seems a mite bit too much for my wallet, but if it ever goes on sale, I'd snatch it up in a heartbeat.\"],\n",
       " 41: [\"Disclaimer: I've played the free versions of this series for more than 300 hours, probably near 400. (about half of it spent with Gemcraft Labyrinth). Gemcraft has always been my favourite tower defense game by far, the difference between this series and any other TD is just ridiculous. Main reasons why I love this series as a whole: Pause button and ability to act during pause . I hate TD's where I need to act quickly. This allows me to think about what to do at any time I want to. Pretty much everything has a hotkey , which makes the gameplay a bit smoother compared to clicking everything. You're always doing something. It's really rare that you get through a wave without building or doing some micromanagement with your towers. The math in the game. Everything is told with calculatable numbers. I hate TD's that only tell something like 'A high damage, low speed missile tower' with no numbers to tell me what it really does. 148 levels. This is not some basic 'get high score in these 10 levels' tower defense, but it has a story/lore, hidden stuff, multiple ways of progression/upgrades, etc. The insanely good difficulty scaling. It's not an automatic scaling, but I can choose how difficult I want the game to be. At easiest, it's pretty easy (and boring) to be honest. But you can adjust stuff that changes the gameplay a lot like 'next wave comes faster', 'you gain mana in waves instead of a constant stream', 'faster scaling', 'reduced effect of Slow', and of course, endurance mode in any level. You can enable multiple different things at once, and harder settings means more exp = more skills = you can go for even higher difficulty. Difficulty scaling from 'easier than breathing' to 'failed in first wave' also means that this game has a difficulty for anyone. Want casual click-and-watch-explosions? You got it. Want to see how long you can survive against impossible odds? You got it. Every fail is caused by you and you only. The problem I see with most TD's is the situation where you think 'I have no idea which order I should build these towers to complete this level'. But because of the difficulty scaling and the complexity of the game in general, I've never had that feeling in Gemcraft. The difficulty scaling causes me to always try harder settings before hitting a wall of 'oh sh*t I went too high' like that damn Icarus. But because it was my own choice to begin with, it's just a facepalm moment and retry, instead of feeling that the game is peeing in my cereals. Continuing with difficulty scaling: even in mid-fight, you can make any wave of monsters harder by spending mana on it . Killing these waves rewards you with even more mana, but doing this requires you to really know your limits: anger them too much and they'll eat you alive. Using this mechanic is pretty much required to beat the hardest levels and difficulties, and it turns the game to a constant balancing of 'how much can I take?'. This mechanic is unique among the TD's that I've played, and it's also one of the many reasons I love this game. The usual 'get a bonus by sending in the next wave earlier' is there aswell. The whole series is pretty much like Dark Souls of the tower defense genre. If you get into it, you'll say that it's the best one. The caveat is that it isn't the easiest game to get into, and it isn't for everyone. The free version of this game can be found at . I'm not even sure what's the difference because I bought this edition instantly after noticing it's on Steam. But I'd say go try the free one, and if you notice that you run out of content before getting bored with the game, come back here. TL;DR: In the end it's still a tower defense game, but it's filled with loads of unique ideas/mechanics and everything is polished to the limit and above. For me it's the game that made every other TD suck just because they aren't nearly as good as Gemcraft.\",\n",
       "  \"Gemcraft series is the ultimate Tower Defense experience for me, and 'Chasing Shadows' is the best instalment so far. At first glance it may work and look like a standard TD game - monsters enter the map in waves, walk to our base along predefined paths and we have to defend it by building towers and traps, as well as occasionally using some spells. However, not only Gemcraft does it superbly but it also offers depth and complexity you won't find in most TD games. The most unique and fun feature of the game, in my opinion, is the wave angering. Player can spend some mana to make monster waves stronger (by increasing monster numbers and stats), which allows you to gain more mana and experience from killing the IF you can kill them that is. This one feature changes the gameplay from simple defense to the 'how far can I push it' competition. Another feature, which adds extra replayability value, is the ability to customize levels. It's pretty fun to return to some of early levels later in the game to see how much stronger you have become by beating the level with some extra difficulty settings. You can add more waves, make monsters stronger, faster, tougher or tweak some game rules to get a harder map with higher experience multiplayer. Ah, the experience - player character can gain levels and unlock various skills and spells which will increase his efficiency in killing monster filth. There is no level cap, however some skills (not all) have a limit to which they can be improved. Add to it a wizard's talisman which can be socketed with talisman fragments gathered along your journey and you get quite a few ways of progressing, improving and specialising your character. However, Gemcraft originally being a flash game, has some shortcomings. To many people graphics would be the biggest one. Despite it being pretty 'clean', readable and fitting the game's darker theme, it's still 2D graphics in low resolution without all those fireworks that other games have nowadays. Personally I prefer it that way, but to each his own. I have spent dozens of hours (flash version on ArmorGames, so obviously Steam won't show this time) with this game and can safely recommend it to other Tower Defense games fans. If you are unsure then you may try the free version of the game on ArmorGames to see if you like it. In any case be advised that GemCraft is not a game you can finish in a few hours. There are dozens of levels and some of the later ones can take as much as an hour to finish.\",\n",
       "  'Overview Magicite is a rogue like platformer that has a mix of survival and exploration elements mixed in. The games developers SmashGames have create a game that is not only fun to play but challenging if not downright merciless. The game was originally on steams early access but has since left but is still updated with the funds that were raised on Kickstarter. Story Magicite doesn’t really have a story. But townsfolk that can be found between the levels can be spoken to and can give you a bit of info about the world. Gameplay Magicite seem to draw idea and concepts of other game, the platforming from games like Spelunky and the survival system from Minecraft as well as some RPG elements. The first thing that the player is required is to create is their character. At first the level of choice the player has is very limited with only two different hairstyle and the ability to roll a dice to determine what stats and the two random traits they will receive. After a few good play through, other options will be unlocked such as new races, hats and companions that can give some extra buffs and make the game easier. Different races have a different set of starting gear. Hats have special effect and companions will provide passive effects. After the player create their character they are dropped into a forest biome with the starting item of their race. Every level is randomly generated when a level is completed the player will be given a choice of three other biomes which are also randomly generated. Player can visit towns in between levels were item can be bought or sold as well as craft new ones. When the player level up that gain more stat points and with be able to skills from skill trees melee, magic and ranged. Player can have three skill and they are given to them randomly. Player must collected resources to craft new tool to help in the higher level as well to help manage hunger. Crafting is easy to make an item you must combine two other items. They are not many recipes so they are easy to learn and you just need better material to make better items. Magicite is an unforgiving game health pools are few and far between and potion are rare. Playing with friend can make it easier because downed player can be revived by another player. However the reviver is left vulnerable for about three second. The controls for Magicite are for keyboard and mouse only, the keyboard for moving and the mouse for interacting and aiming. The control are very responsive which is so important in a platformer with this level of difficulty. Visuals Magicite has a very retro feel with it simple 16-bit graphics and bright and vibrant colours, with the games background being as dark as it is make the colours stand out even more. The game can scale to high resolution without any problem. Audio The Audio like the visuals has a very retro 16-bit feel. However the is no menu music which is a little strange but once in the game the music is great. Overall I love the game from it brutal difficulty to its retro art style and soundtrack the game has so much replay ability, and with the controls being as responsive as they are SmashGames have created something that mixes survival, RPG, roguelike and platforming into something truly great. Anybody that likes a challenge, platformers or just like to play game with some friends or by your self should definitely give this game a go. ',\n",
       "  'I recently discovered Magicite, a cool horizontal scrolling platform game blending some RPG and crafting elements, with combat and magic. I’ve always been a fan of the ‘sideways scroller’, from Super Mario Bros. to R-Type (I would add Jet Set Willy here but it’s room-based and not strictly a scrolling landscape…) and the simple mechanics of running, jumping and picking stuff up is forever engraved on the fabric of the gaming universe. The beauty here is the Magicite world is procedurally generated – not a new concept in games but it creates a wonderfully unique environment each time, albeit a very familiar one, with platforms, monsters, chests, trees and other resources with which to interact. Oh and Magicite is a Rogue-like game. So when you dead… you dead. Each level in Magicite is one of a limited set of ‘biomes’ – forest, swamp, fire-land each with different creatures and hazards. In single player, it can be fiendishly difficult particularly if you get a bad level generation (lots of monsters and not much space to manoeuvre) but once you get started and build up a stash of items, weapons and armour, you’re on your way. You can chop trees to collect wood and sticks, turn the wood into planks and the sticks into handles, turn the planks into blades and make tools and weapons: axes, picks and swords. Then you can mine stone, and iron, gold and diamond to make better tools and weapons… and armour. The better the tools, the more resources you get. The better the armour, the more likely you are to survive. And creatures can drop hide and pelt, food to eat and other useful things. Your character needs to eat regularly as well as keep their health topped up with potions. At the end of each level is a choice of three doorways. The doorway you choose decides the next level so it’s best to stick to forests or swamps for the first few so you can build up resources and items, and have a fighting chance of making it to the end. In between levels are ‘towns’; safe (ish) areas for buying and selling, crafting metal bars and making armour and clothing. It is probably important to say at this point that Magicite has some vague archetypes for developing characters. You can focus on melee combat and make metal armour (fighter), or make bows and arrows and hide armour (ranger), or make wands and cloth armour (wizard); all these things can affect your stats, how much damage you inflict, and can take, how fast you move and your magical ability. Progression through levels also increases these things depending on your race and other abilities. To start with, you are limited to one race but a neat achievement system unlocks different races, variants, hats (oh yes) and companions which become available for your next run. Another feature, one that is intensely annoying to start with, is the Scourge. If you spend too long on a level, a nasty monster turns up and beats the crap out of you – unless you get to one of the doorways. This gives a sense of urgency and propels you through the levels, creating a fast and often chaotic game. It has a multi-player mode which is when the game comes alive. Even playing with one other person improves the game considerably. One of you can focus on wood while the other is the miner, one can be melee while the other is ranged. The magic side is probably the most difficult to master but very powerful. You have to collect bugs (using nets made from sticks and spider webs) to make gems with which to craft wands. Some things need NPCs (metal bars, cloth) but most things can be combined by hand and on-the-fly as you fight through levels. There are a few ‘bosses’ in Magicite. Destroying spider nests will inevitably spawn a brood mother – this is pain at the start but soon you will be destroying every nest you can find to increase your loot, and a final boss can be found on the last level. I’ve been lucky enough to complete Magicite a few times in multi-player (with a lot of help!) and this will unlock some of the powerful achievements. It would be great to see Magicite expand into a more complex game, especially the crafting which is very limited, while retaining its simple concept. More variety and unique items would be great, like the wand that generates zombies, as well as more weapons and armour. The game could also use a few new biomes with more variety but overall it’s a great concept, fun to play and challenging.',\n",
       "  \"I am writing this rather quickly, in order for it to be available to those considering Magicite while it is on sale, but it should accurately reflect my views on the game. Magicite is most definitely a roguelike, at least in the Isaac/Spelunky sense. It is not a game of a different genre with roguelike elements. However, there are certain aspects that, in my eyes, make it rather odd for a roguelike. I will get to those in a moment. First, the basic concept of the game. In Magicite, you are a solitary adventurer in an underground realm called Deephaven, the place to which the surface dwellers have retreated in the face of an invasion by an enemy called the Scourge. Your objective is to make your way from District One to District 20, the Scourge Lair, and to kill their (assumed) leader, the Scourge Wall (which is rather like the Wall of Flesh from Terraria). In each district, if you linger for too long, the Scourge will appear, and individuals will begin chasing and attacking you, similarly to the Rebel pursuit in FTL or the Ghost in Spelunky. Every other district, starting with District 2, is a town area, with no enemies and an assortment of NPCs, some of which are window dressing and some of which are merchants or artisans. Within regular districts, you will find resources, mainly trees and rocks, which can be harvested Minecraft-style with pickaxes or hatchets. There are also herb patches, which can drop several ingredients, and small shrubs with magical insects living inside, which give special magical regents. Each district, aside from the first and the last, can have one of various biomes. At the end of each odd-numbered district is a set of three doors, each of which is color-coded to show the biome to which it leads. You may pick one then, which will take you to the town level, and then to the biome you picked. Early on they will usually only offer easy biomes, with many resources and weak enemies, with the options gradually becoming more challenging over time. Now, how is this game odd for a roguelike? First, there is a relatively small assortment of items in the game. At first many will be suprises, but after a while, you may come to expect most possible drops- and this includes rare treasure items that are uncraftable. I don't consider this bad, as such, but it heavily reduces the differences from run to run. Second, because most of the items necessary to do well are craftable, you can usually get roughly the same level of equipment run to run by the same points in the game, if you follow the right 'build order' of items, which also tends to reduce the novelty each run. And third, although each District is randomly generated, ones of a given biome are nearly always highly similar to others of the same biome- although admittedly, different biomes are drastically different and interesting. A Swamp level will, at least in my experience, feel pretty much the same as any other Swamp level most of the time. You could argue that Nuclear Throne does the same, with many of its zones, but although many times the, say, first three levels are highly similar to variants you have played before, they are also sometimes quite different instead. In Magicite, that rarely happens, in my experience. Now, I may come across as dislike the game based on this commentary- but actually, other aspects of Magicite more than make up for these points, and honestly, I have grown to like these three aspects of the game. In most roguelikes, because of just how random things become, you have no idea how things will go beforehand. One run in either Isaac could well be different in every particular from your previous run. And in some roguelikes, such as Tower of Guns or Ziggurat, the layout of the first couple floors could well determine if you manage to make it far or if you die immediately, even after a few hours of playing. In Magicite, you can largely determine how you want to play a run when you set up your character, and most of the time, the challenge of a particular biome will be the same run to run, meaning that your success or failure is due almost completely to your own ability- not to snub any of these other games, all of which I greatly enjoy. My point is, because there are many other games which play out different, Magicite's constancy (for a roguelike) makes it somewhat unique, and for me, a pleasing alternative. But most importantly, there are many aspects of Magicite that I find wonderful in and of themselves. Combat- with magic and ranged as well, but primarily melee- weighty and precise, simple and yet difficult to use properly, allowing you to evade most every attack against you if you are practiced enough, yet also making it so that even a few mistakes may end your life. It reminds me some of Monster Hunter, although on a smaller, more responsive scale. Combat Styles- as hinted above, this game has melee, magic, and ranged. Each one feels substantially different, and each one can be used by the same character; or, you can specialize in only one, through armor and leveling. Yes, this game has level-ups, through experience orbs that dead monsters drop. As you level, you will get to pick three skills, each time given the option to choose a class. You will get a random skill (from a small pool) for the class that you picked. You can pick all three from the same class, or one from each, or whatever combination seems strongest for the character you want. It adds an interesting element to the game that otherwise would not exist. Unlockables- most roguelikes have these, and Magicite handles them quite well. There are three types of unlockables: character races, companions, and hats. Races each begin with modifications to their base stats and up to three starting items. Companions provide some form of passive bonus, such as periodic healing or stronger level-ups. And hats provide a single special bonus, varying from a chance to gather double resources from certain sources to special magical attacks from attacking barehanded. All three types allow for interesting builds, especially some of the more difficult to obtain ones. And some are very difficult- such as to beat the game without taking a point of damage, ever. To my knowledge, all are doable, but some seem incredibly difficult. When you set up a character, you pick a race, one companion and one hat, thereby letting you decide how your run will be focused. And finally, Music- which is just superb. Minecraft is my high mark in ambient music, which I have never seen surpassed myself, but Magicite, with some of its town themes and biome songs, comes close. Honestly, just have a listen. All of these combine to make Magicite a suprisingly unique, enjoyable roguelike that feels far more special that it may look at first glance. I would highly recommend this game, especially on sale as it is now. The developer has consistently shown commitment to updating and improving the game, so it could well become even better with time. TL;DR- Magicite is a unique, engaging, and beautiful roguelike that has far more going for it then it may appear to have, although it does not have the same difference between runs and sheer variety of possible items that many other roguelikes have. \"],\n",
       " 42: [\"Sequel to Hexcells , Hexcells Plus offers more of the same as the original, excellent logic puzzler but with considerably more challenge. This can be both a good and a bad thing. Because of the higher challenge level, I strongly recommend you to first play the original Hexcells. Game has changed little from the original Hexcells. User interface (UI) is exactly the same as before. Just like in Hexcells, you have to deduce whether hexes are blue or black based on simple rules similar to Hanjies and Mine Sweeper. However, the puzzles are completely new. The sequel adds one new mechanic: now blue cells can also have a number on them that dictates how many hexes in two cells' radius are blue. Still no guessing is required at all: everything can be logically deduced. Music has changed a bit but it retains the ambient theme from the original. Just like in Hexcells, there are 36 well-designed, challenging puzzles. Unlike Hexcells, the challenge level jumps up very quickly, and the further you get, the longer the puzzles will take to complete (assuming you are not guessing and strive for perfection). Coming straight from Hexcells it's alright but starting out it would be a bit too much. Especially the new mechanic of numbered blue cells can make it difficult to understand what's going on, though the UI has a convenient helping function to keep your thoughts straight. Unfortunately at least I had to resort to the infamous 'try and exclude' deduction strategy way more often in this sequel than in the original game, so the puzzles can drag a lot longer. The lack of saving option within puzzles can become a drag if you find yourself in a hurry. I still recommend Hexcells Plus to anyone who liked the original Hexcells and was left craving for more. The upped difficulty level is more hardcore though and I can't emphasize this quality too much. For me the game took some 10 hours to complete fully, while original Hexcells was just a 2-hour stroll. If you want a smoother difficulty curve and a more pleasant a sequel considering the difficulty level, you should skip straight to Hexcells Infinite that also finally adds saves and random levels. In that effect Hexcells Plus shares many problems of its predecessor: it has limited content that lacks replayability after being completed and saving feature before that. However, it also shares most of its virtues: well-designed, albeit (perhaps) too challenging puzzles (when compared to the original one) with pretty much perfect user interface and audiovisual outlook for its game type. For challenge's sake it continues from where Hexcells was left so in that effect it is also a fine sequel for the puzzle enthusiast.\",\n",
       "  \"I have already played 'Hexcells Plus' which is the second part of the trilogy. I must say that 'Hexcells' is significantly easier than 'Hexcells Plus'. Took me less than 2 hours to complete it but it's an awesome puzzle game and I can't wait to play the third part (Hexcells Infinite). Got both 'Hexcells' and 'Hexcells Infinite' games on sale. If you like puzzle games I recommend you to buy the trilogy if you have enough funds. :)\",\n",
       "  \"Traditional Rating - 94/100 Recommendation - Like Hexcells, but Plus! Remember the free old Windows game Minesweeper? Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream 'NOOOOOOOOOOO' whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing? WELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue. Hexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess. The levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying. Speaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it. The Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite. It's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Scratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!\",\n",
       "  'At first I thought that the Hexcells series were minesweeper clones. However, the later puzzles introduced some mechanics that made things more complex. As someone who enjoyed playing minesweeper, this was a very nice game. This one is a continuation of the original Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, and is actually harder in my opinion. Further, Hexcells Infinite has a random puzzle generator, hence the Infinite in the name. So if you are thinking of getting only one Hexcells game, this is the one to get. It also has a slightly better UI than the earlier two games.',\n",
       "  \"First of all, if you're considering getting this before playing regular Hexcells - don't. Hexcells Plus is far more difficult than the original and for me, that sapped some of the fun out of it. I LOVE the original Hexcells and recommend it wholeheartedly. It's a casual, relaxing little game that introduces you to some new puzzles that will stretch your mind a little by challenging you to think in a new way. A lot of people compare it to Minesweeper, with the major distinction being that you never have to guess in Hexcells. You can reach the solution to each puzzle with logic alone. The difficulty curve on the original is great and most likely the whole way through you're going to have a smile on your face and feel enough of a challenge as new methods are introduced. Is it going to leave you wanting more? More than likely. That's where Hexcells Plus comes in and why I was really looking forward to it. Did it provide me with more Hexcells? Yes. Did it give me more of the Hexcells I love? No. The new puzzle solving techniques introduced in Hexcells Plus, although a logical progression, take it too far. What the original Hexcells has in common with Minesweeper (other than searching a grid to mark empty and occupied tiles) is an addictive simplicity. In Hexcells Plus, by making things more complicated to up the difficulty level, some of that charming simplicity is lost and sorely missed. Bottom Line - Hexcells Plus is not simply more Hexcells. It will most appeal, I think, to people who felt the original was too easy. I thought the orignal was just right. Hexcells Plus isn't a bad game by any means and I'm happy to support the developer but it's hard not to compare it to the original and be a little disappointed.\"],\n",

(Took a few months to recover before uploading my designs to I own SpaceChem and 63 Corvi on Android, iOS, and PC (Both on steam and DRM free). 3 SpaceChem t-shirts, all of the swag you can imagine that was created by Zachtronics for the game and I have easily over 4000 hours played across all platforms (not to mention the ridiculous amount of time I spent doodling and planning on chemistry lab graph paper). With that out of the way here's a review: Warning, this game is not for hardcore puzzle game fans. This game is specifically for those who need to be obsessed with puzzles to the point of tryharding. Have you ever thought you could beat Tetris? Have you ever actually beaten Tetris? That's what playing SpaceChem feels like. SpaceChem is incredibly tedious and it will cause you mental anguish to the point where you might have a nervous breakdown. Need proof? Here's the statistics of people who actually complete the game: (Without Guides) Image courtesy: / You'll note that the further players get in the game the less they want/are able to finish it.

It's like an IQ test, if you apply yourself you will succeed, if you're haphazard about it (Like using guides or other players solutions) you will still succeed but it will make it much much easier than if you had just tried on your own. Most levels in this game have hundreds of millions of potential ways to solve EACH SECTION of the puzzle. If you try you will complete every level it is just a matter of designing your solutions. I know my summary score and my personal score don't add up, but this game is a 5/5. it is a masterpiece and just because the audio/story/visuals aren't 'the best' it is a legendary game and deserves no less than a perfect score.

       "  \"SpaceChem is a really excellent puzzle game—if “puzzle game” is even the right way to describe it (more on this in a moment). It casts the player as an engineer working for an outer-space industrial operation—your job is to program and arange the reactors that recombine chemical elements for various industrial purposes. Right up front it’s worth noting that SpaceChem isn’t actually a chemistry game. Ignorance of actual chemistry isn’t a hindrance. The actual game play consists of setting up tracks which carry chemical components around within a reactor, and inserting commands to make sure that what you want ends up where you want it. In some stages there is a further level of complexity where you must set up and connect multiple reactors to be used together. All this has a lot more to do with computer programming than it does which chemistry. In fact, it seems fair to say that SpaceChem is like the fun part of programming separated from all the arcane knowledge and headache that go along with it. You are, in essence, issuing simple commands to a machine to enable it to complete complex tasks. (People who have coded may also feel some déjà vu as they set about finding the bugs in the operation of reactors they’ve already set up—it feels just like debugging Here is where SpaceChem is so different from most other puzzle games. Instead of being faced with a problem to which you must FIND a solution, here you are faced with an objective and you must DESIGN a solution. These stages are less puzzles than engineering tasks. And possible approaches to the SpaceChem stages are innumerable and call on your creativity as much as your deduction. This is emphasized by the feedback you get once you’ve completed a stage which compares your solution to all the others on record along several dimensions. For me, this added an incentive not just to beat a level, but to keep returning to my solution: surely I could find a way to do it faster, or with fewer instructions than the others who’d solved it. Thus the replayability of even a single stage is vast. That is the real strength and focus of the game, the core structure of the problem solving. Some other elements are less strong. The visuals are very simple, though, for the most part, I think this brings an abstract elegance. The story, such as it is, is darkly comedic but tacked on and not really worth your attention. And the boss battles, essentially normal stages with some sort of twist in how you apply your chemistry, are awkward and un-compelling as if an afterthought to the game’s design. But these complaints are peripheral to the core excellence of the game as an opportunity for creative, structured problem solving. (And don’t take the creative bit to mean it isn’t challenging.

       " 47: ['I backed the game for the basic tier during the Kickstarter campaign. Dropsy is a charming adventure game that aside from a few pixel hunting hiccups is a quality game. Dropsy may look like a creepy clown but all he wants to do is help people and his adventure is quite the heartwarming one as you can have Dropsy make everyone in his town feel better. With a great atmosphere and likable cast, Dropsy is a definitely an adventure game worth your time.',\n",
       "  \"Dropsy is a classic point-and-click adventure game but with some new and interesting ideas. The protagonist is Dropsy the Clown and you spread hugs and happiness. Dropsy cannot speak to anyone, so you have to figure out the puzzles by images. The game has a distinct visual art style and a lot of subtle humor. If you generally enjoy adventure games, you'll most likely be happy playing Dropsy. Check out my First Impressions here: \",\n",
       "  \"Dropsy is a unique point and clck adventure. I loved everything about it. It has an original character in Dropsy the clown, who just want to help and befriend people, to make them happy. He is not alone in his quests and as his story progresses he will go through some challanges and grow as a character. The interface of the game does not contain any text, no any that you can read in some known language anyway. You'll have to make sense of pictograms, which is presumably how Dropsy perceives and/or senses people's (but not only people's) feelings/ needs/ mood. There are some other clever mechanics at work here, since you can use your companions to assist Dropsy in his quests and additionally Dropsy can hug almost everyone and everything! The game for the most part had quite a feel-good vibe going for it. The story will take some darker paths, eventually but there is always something positive or upbeat and it tries to never leave you in absolute depressive or bad mood. The puzzles are logic and most of them are of easy difficulty. The game's world and many characters are quite weird (in a way that reminded me of the classic LucasArt's Sam 'n Max). The story is interesting and it will leave quite an impression on you. The music is very fitting and well done. The pixel art and animations are great! I would absolutely recommend Dropsy to any point and click adventure game fan.\",\n",
       "  \"(Review originally published on Gamemoir .) Dropsy is a bit difficult to describe in words. After all this game embraces “show, don't tell” by having absolutely zero dialogue or exposition. But as an advocate for the power and utility of words, I should probably give it a shot. Being nice is hard. For Dropsy though—the eponymous moist demonic-faced clown—it is simply second nature. He's the last innocent in a jaded world. By some sinister stroke of misfortune however, Dropsy's circus tent has burned down and the blame is pinned on him. Townspeople are quick to turn against him. It's up to Dropsy to prove their reactions wrong by performing good deeds—doing so only because that is simply Dropsy's way. One of the most interesting aspects of Dropsy's gamplay is its nonlinearity. An open world point-and-click adventure? Outrageous! By nonlinear I mean that almost the entire map is available to explore from the get-go. This is a questionable tactic for an adventure game, as it is overwhelming for the player to have so much immediately available. There's a reason after all why most adventure games are step-by-step structured—it is easier and more fluid for the player to process the information that way. Overlapping sidequests and mainquests mean a lot of inventory-collecting and information-gathering without a clear idea of how either is to be implemented. The result makes Dropsy suffer from a general lack of direction, the player not receiving much feedback from their actions nor gaining a definite sense of progress. Open world also means traversing the same maps over and over again, which can be repetitive. A day and night cycle makes the exploration even more daunting. Yet the charm and liveliness of the world is undeniable. An eclectic, catchy soundtrack complements the bright, vibrant visuals. The music ranges from hardcore punk to poppy little diddies, the musicians here composing fantastically low-fi representations of popular genres. Meanwhile the pixel art is beautiful, with a variety of unique settings and smooth animations. The characters are diverse and endearing. Three little critter buddies accompany you—a bird, a mouse and a dog (whose mission is ostensibly to pee on as many things as he can). Along the way, Dropsy also runs into an angry all-women punk band, a preacher who believes that rock music is the devil, a vampire-fearing cult and the corrupt CEO of a pharmaceutical pastry corporation. To name just a few. Dialogue is shown through visual symbols. For instance, a character complains about work. Instead of simply saying “I hate work,” the character's speech bubble has a little person with a shovel followed by a red circle with a cross through it. Nonverbal communication in an adventure is a phenomenal idea, performed well in the past by Machinarium. The difference here is that Machinarium had a very simple plot. Dropsy meanwhile is ceaselessly complicated. This demands a lot of attention on the part of the player. On its own this isn't asking too much—it only gets increasingly convoluted as we delver further into a plot involving aliens, conspiracy and evil corporations. Things get a little lost in translation. Dropsy also at times refuses to keep the player in the loop of its game world logic. Take, for example, when the player might want to enter the nightclub in town. As an adventure game, would we not want to explore every single possible location? Yet whenever the player tries to make Dropsy enter the club, he simply walks in front of it then shrugs. No clear indication of why he cannot enter is given. Other similar information is often failed to be communicated to the player—instead of explanations, we are often just met with a shrug. Despite problems with a sense of plot progression and generally just getting lost in the game world, there is an undeniable satisfaction to going around doing nice things for people and getting hugs. It is one of the purest examples of positive feedback in gaming—do good things and people will like you more, will want to support and assist you. Dropsy's rather horrifying appearance is ignored in lieu of his benevolent actions. It is heartwarming to see, both funny and touching. While Dropsy isn't quite as fun as it could have been, it does have its moments. Some puzzles, such as a sequence in which you must break into a building as a mouse, are quite challenging and clever. The world it builds is inimitable. It just doesn't flow as smoothly as it might—the player finds the narrative moving in jumps and starts, progressing almost accidentally as they stumble upon new information, collect a new item or else discover a new location. This can be frustrating to experience, make the game more tedious than need be. As a whole, though, there is nothing else like Dropsy out there. It has its shortcomings, but it is a one-of-a-kind, lovable, huggable experience. For that alone it is worth playing. A copy of the game was provided by the developer for review on PC.\",\n",
       "  \"Dropsy is a point and click adventure game with a really interesting pixel graphic art style that was released in September 2015, being developed by Tendershoot and A Jolly Corpse. In all good point and click style, Dropsy is a confusing yet very entertaining adventure game. The game’s puzzles and game world environment are all extremely interesting to explore and solve. Following the trend of classic point and clicks, some of the puzzles make no sense what so ever and you will be resorting to the help of forums and wiki posts to progress without wanting to spoil too much of the surprise. Dropsy the clown only wants to help people, as you wander around the modern day world solving small puzzles for anyone you come across, all you want in return is a simple hug. It has a very creepy vibe throughout the whole game that is portrayed excellently through the main character, Dropsy. Very early on in the game you assemble a party of three other characters, these are a dog, a bird and a mouse. These other party members can be used to complete puzzles, find more items and explore parts of the environment that Dropsy would not otherwise be able to do himself. The art style in Dropsy is gorgeous. The pixel art style that takes you back to yesteryear showing off exactly how you pull of the pixel graphics to a very high standard. The game’s animation of all the character is splendid too, with not one wrong move being seen throughout. You will also be very creeped out by a lot of the art in the game too; some of it is very trippy, a lot of it has a really dark feel to it whilst being in a very colourful scheme, but this fits very well with the main character being a Clown though. The art is definitely my favourite aspect of this game. Even though the game does not have any spoken English dialogue, you are still able to get a grasp of the game’s plot. It has some very sad and tragic undertones, whilst also being bright and cheerful at points too. Most of the game’s story is portrayed with the use of thought bubbles above character’s head. I thought this was a very interesting way of getting the plot across to the player as it leaves a lot of it up to the player’s imagination as well. Dropsy was a very difficult game to complete; I think if I didn’t have the aid of a walkthrough at times I probably wouldn’t have been able to complete it. Some of the puzzles and solutions are just fundamentally whacky and I really don’t see how anyone could solve them without some sort of prior knowledge of the game. Throughout the game, you will also have the opportunity to collect lots of collectable items as well, this adds to the game’s longevity and offers a little diversion from the main plot when you need a bit of a break. I finished Dropsy in just under six hours; this was with completing the majority of the side puzzles for the citizens of the town on top of collecting the other items as well. The game is split into 5 chapters as sort, the first four chapters take about an hour each to complete, whereas the last chapter is more or less just one long cut scene with very little interaction being needed at all. There isn’t any real replay ability in the title as the ending will be the same whatever, but there has been points which you can change the reaction of some of the characters in the latter stage of the game, depending on how you treated them on your play through – whilst this may not be a massive change on the game, it may add a little replay ability for fans of the point and click genre. I didn’t have any technical problems during my play through, there isn’t a tutorial in the game, but if you have some knowledge of point and click games, you will be able to work it out very quickly as the inventory and controls are all the same. Dropsy is one of the better point and click games I have played in recent memory, with a very exciting but sad story on top of some beautiful graphics and art style. The game’s low price of £6, 99 should be considered a bargain given the production values on show here. I cannot recommend this top notch indie title enough. Tom's Score Card 1) Stay away 2) Not Recommended 3) Only recommended when on sale 4) Recommended 5) Highly recommended 6) This is a must play If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

       "  \"If you are looking for a good rhythm/music game on Steam look no further. Beat Hazard is quite possibly your best choice in this situation. As simple as it may look, Beat Hazard is an amazing game with a buttload of replay value. There is no plot besides a small explanation of what happens - you are a pilot of a spaceship and you have to survive other ships' attacks (and sometimes asteroids). There is a small catch though - everything is generated on the go from the loaded MP3 file . You choose your favorite song(s), load them up and blast! Everything depends on the song you chose - the more intense the music is at the moment, the faster and stronger your bullets get, the faster your enemies fly by etc. The game itself is, to be honest, kinda dull. The DLCs, however, are what really drives this game home. Cold Beam Games did an outstanding job on creating them. Beat Hazard Ultra is more of a full-blown expansion pack. It adds so many new things to the game (new enemies, new perks, new gamemodes you will forget what it was to play the vanilla game! Shadow Operations Unit is an excellent choice for people who always seek out to complete new objectives! This one adds new ships to control, each one differing in stats and overall gameplay, Workshop support and missions to complete (such as getting X points, destroying Y enemy ships). If you ever get in the mood to play your games to the rhythm of your music (and even if you're simply looking for a good game), I strongly recommend Beat Hazard. It's one of those cheaper games which actually can make a gamer stick with it for a long time. (For all of you lazy bums looking for a TL;DR: 10/10).\",\n",

       " 52: [\"The concept of LYNE is so simple that you will learn it watching the store page video or playing for first few puzzles, yet as you progress through the tier sets (which contain a massive 650 puzzles!), this simple concept turns into some very complex puzzle scenarios. Larger game grids, more colours/lines to connect or three-way instead of two-way blocks are some modifiers used throughout to increase the difficulty each set. Once you get into the second half of the game there are some real challenging levels that will leave you scratching your head for a long time (& occasionally swearing at your monitor)! To give you an example, here is some unedited footage of me trying to solve a more challenging level (mistakes and all!): Graphics are clear, mouse controls are intuitive, achievements & cards, and also has daily set challenges of randomly generated puzzles to test you further. The daily sets, plus the 650 standard puzzles is a huge amount of content for such a small price tag. There really isn't any negatives to this great little puzzle game, although if I was to be picky some of the colour pallette sets are a bit hard on the eyes :) Thankfully, not a big deal as you can set it to your liking once you unlock pallettes through game progression. If you like games that challenge your mind (& sometimes your sanity!) then LYNE is well worth checking out.

       "  'An intuitive little visual puzzle game, with a wonderful minimalist style, mellow soundtrack and engaging gameplay. LYNE is incredibly simple: join the dots, but with rules. Create lines on a grid joining matching coloured shapes, making sure not to miss any or leave any paths untravelled. Sounds easy? It’s not. Each Puzzle is part of a Set; 25 Puzzles to a Set, 26 Sets in the main Game, so 650 puzzles in just the main Game, which continues with new Daily Sets. As you progress through the sets, they increase in size and difficulty, getting very challenging; the daily sets can also vary in difficulty, so no day is the same. The elegant and abstract style of the game really helps to engage the player, focusing on just the puzzle, with no superfluous window dressing, just a simple layout and interface for such a devious challenge. It’s chilled out, almost zen-like, soundtrack also helps set the mood for a relaxed and engaging puzzle solving session. After I finish playing, I usually feel relaxed and focused; it’s almost meditative. The accessible play style makes the game great for casual gaming, able to drop in and out of gameplay whenever you like. You can hardcore through the game pretty quickly, but really, it’s made for casual play, whiling away 15-30 minutes here or there, enjoying soothing music and mentally challenging puzzles. LYNE has various achievements to unlock, as well as collectible triangles with each puzzle solved, which in turn unlock different colour palettes for the game dependent on amount of triangles collected, as well as unlocking hidden features such as a sub-game involving Twitter and a hidden cypher - I don’t use Twitter, so not too sure what’s involved there, but it’s cool that games are expanding to use social media in such ways. I bought this during the Xmas sale, after spotting a review that mentioned you could spell out words with the LYNE achievement badges - each Set is a Letter of the Alphabet, and each unlocked Achievement is a corresponding Letter Badge - and actually thought that was a worthwhile idea, but after playing it I’m glad I bought it, regardless, because it’s a great game for casual play. It’s immediately recognisable as similar in concept to various casual games on Mobile devices Flow), but none have pulled it off with the style and elegance of LYNE; it’s so pretty, simple and fun! Thumbs up, and definitely recommended!',\n",
       "  'Puzzle games in my eyes need a few things to be entertaining, addicting tests of your wits. They should be easy to pick up, with basic rules that don’t require lengthy tutorials or wordy instructions to understand. They ought to be dynamic, built on a framework that can be easily reworked into a continual stream of interesting puzzles that don’t become repetitive despite being similar if not identical in design. And lastly I prefer them to be easy to pick up and put down, like a coffee table book that you can spend a few minutes or hours passing the time with, then set it back down for an unknown amount of time and still find it just as enjoyable the next time you look at it. LYNE seems to have unknowingly looked into my head and designed itself around these ideals, forming into a simple but exemplary brain teaser that I fell in love with from the very first screen. It’s a relaxing yet engrossing experience that excels at putting you in a zen like state as you clear puzzles and feel especially clever each and every time you do. In essence, LYNE can best be thought of as a nonlinear connect-the-dots. You’re given two points that you must connect, while going through all of the requisite points between them, but the order in which you do so is entirely up to you. There isn’t necessarily only one way to solve a puzzle, and this freedom is but one reason I find LYNE hugely refreshing compared to so many other puzzle games. As you progress you begin to deal with multiple colors, points you must repeatedly run through, and more complex designs that have you connecting lines like a mad cartographer, which from the outside looking on would seem highly complex and difficult. But, it never feels that way when you’re playing. The fundamentals are so basic that it feels almost innate, like you’ve already been doing this for years. Something about LYNE clicked with me instantly, allowing me to breeze through level after level without an abundance of difficulty but leaving that satisfying feeling of accomplishment when you flex your frontal lobe and solve a problem. The soothing ambient sounds and mellow colors do well to elicit a calm mindset, making this an ideal way to let loose of your tension and unwind as you focus on the problem at hand. In a similar way that many treat Sudoku and crossword puzzles, LYNE has something of a habitual quality; something you can go back to every day to help keep you sharp and relax after the more trying events of a day. The structure is tailor made for this style of play, with puzzles grouped into sets that are just long enough to be rewarding but not fatiguing. Random daily puzzles (though you’d never know that do to them being just as well designed as the base sets) provide consistent new content, at which point I can think of little more I could ask for. Brilliant, Thomas Wowker, brilliant. You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal . ',\n",
       "  \"LYNE is a seemingly simple puzzle game with basic objectives, a multitude of levels, and an euphoric atmosphere. The objectives are simple enough: connect the lines and fill up all of the spaces as you go. As the puzzles progress, different variations in the puzzles create new scenarios, and thus increase the complexity of each puzzle. By completing the puzzle, you progress onward to the next, and so on and so forth. There is no losing in LYNE. There is no time limit, either. You can take as long as you would like to solve each puzzle, and there is no penalty for simply coming back to that puzzle later. In the game, there are 26 levels, ranging from letters A to Z. Each level has sub-levels of 25. This equivalates to 650 puzzles just in the regular game mode alone. However! After completing set A and B (I believe), the player is then allowed access to daily sets. These daily puzzles consist of a version A and B, both having 25 sublevels in them. That's another 50 new puzzles per day. These puzzles range in difficulty and are completely random. With a staggering number of 700+ puzzles in just a week, there is plenty to do on LYNE. Not only is there no pressure for you to whiz by the game, but there is also a very calming and entracing soundtrack that accompanies you as you play. With each movement of the puzzle pieces, there are tones that mix together and with the soundtrack to create some really beautiful, relaxing music. Not only is this music a nice stress-reliever, but there is an actual science behind it. The ambient noises actually promote brainwave activity, thus amplifying a better mood, problem-solving, cognition, and much more. But, hey, who doesn't like to just hear something nice playing in the background? All in all, LYNE is a fantastic game that can be played by any one of any age. Not too mention it is affordable at only (about with a coupon). It's a great way to relax after a long day at work, decompress after some stressful online match, or just to simply pass the time. If you haven't played it already, I strongly recommend that you do. It is really a gem that will have you hooked! 10/10\",\n",
       "  \"I've been slowly adding to my list of relaxing, (mostly) casual puzzle games that I can play both to wind down or get the brain active, and my current list consists of - Kami, Ichi, and Lyne. Of those games, Lyne is easily my favorite, and one that I see myself playing over and over, for the rest of my life. The daily challenges add a lot of replayability to the game. If you like circuit-based puzzles, you will really enjoy this game. The aesthetics are very simple, but also very easy/nice on the eyes. Different shapes of varying color on a basic background make for relaxing gameplay, completely at your own pace. There isn't really any music, however, the sounds made when you clear a level is very soothing, and when you get in the zone, clearing levels very quickly provides good, positive feedback. After you complete several levels, you unlock the ability to switch the background theme to different color palettes, unlocking more options as you progress through the game. The controls are super simple - you just click and drag the mouse to move your circuit to (applicable) areas on the grid. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, however, the higher-difficulty levels can be extremely challenging. Difficulty is indicated by the number of triangles. Each 'set' of levels consists of 25 levels, and there is one set for every letter of the alphabet (26). On top of that, there are daily challenges that are changed throughout the week, starting at the easiest difficulty on Mondays, and increasing to brutal, oh-my-god-just-kill-me-this-is-so-hard-and-I-haven't-slept-yet-trying-to-finish-this-level torture on Sundays. Achievement hunters will have a grand time trying to 100% complete this, and I play this regularly whenever I have some time to fill. As mentioned before, I see myself playing this game for the rest of my life. The goal in Lyne is to get all same-shaped circuits to connect to each other - the two bold shapes are your start and end points (you cannot miss a non-bold shape, and you cannot continue the circuit if you connect the start/end points). As you progress, more colors/shapes will be added, increasing the difficulty. Nodes will eventually appear (double, triple, and quadruple sockets), and these must be filled completely for you to solve the level. Nodes are also critical in the later stages, as they will allow your circuits to cross otherwise uncrossable pathways (ex: if you have a green connection going diagonally, you cannot have other circuits passing through that diagonal line). You can undo your connections at will with no penalty, and there is no time limit - everything is completely at-your-own-pace. One of the best attributes of this game is how it rewards patience, perseverance, and trial-and-error. Many times, I have solved a puzzle by trying every possible route/solution I can think of. Other times, I will go back a few levels and have a sudden moment of clarity because you will realize that most levels in set follow very similar 'themes' to solve the puzzles. For example, one set may have a pattern of having you use the longest path (or the shortest path). There are numerous ways to solve each level, and this is also a great thing, because it ensures that you have multiple ways to complete each level. Overall, this is a great puzzle game that any puzzle enthusiast must try out - especially if you like circuit-based ones. Highly recommend! Cheers, DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews \"],\n",

       "  \"Monaco is a deceptive at screenshots or trailers, you might get the impression that it is one of theses stealth games where you're supposed to go in, grab some loot, and get out like a shadow, without being seen or causing too much mayhem. But Monaco is not one of theses games. Monaco is as much about stealthing some parts, as it is about running around spreading chaos in others. Monaco doesn't care if you cause mayhem, it doesn't care if you kill people or not, it doesn't care if you've been seen or not. The one thing Monaco cares about is how long it took you to do all that. At the end of a level, Monaco only tells you how long it took you, then add a 10s penalty for every coin you missed, and finally, give you your leaderboards rank. Because Monaco is on a fundamental level all about speed. Cleaning levels as fast as you can is what Monaco is about. You can try to play stealthily, and never get seen, but it's not what the level design is made for, and it's probably not even achievable on the later levels, especially if you're trying to get all the loot. So is Monaco a good game in its genre ? Probably, for the few people who enjoy replaying the same level over and over again until they've figured out the perfect path and ends up being lucky in the random placements of loot. The devs had a vision, and they stuck to it, and they've executed well on that front. But most people aren't speedrunners. Most people play a game once (if at all) and are done with it. And for that great majority of players, i can't recommend it. The level design isn't really meant for doing anything else than going for perfect runs. Just getting the main objective and escaping will avoid most of the map and the difficulty, it will feel like skipping the level. Granted there is an decent story arc to follow (though the ending was a letdown), and a great soundtrack, but it's too little if, like me, you don't embrace the main gameplay. So while still respecting the dev's decisions and applauding their great execution, i still give this game a negative recommendation.\"],\n",

       "  \"Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] ( listen); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer ('leader') of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was a central figure of the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria, then part of Austria-Hungary, and raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party, the precursor of the NSDAP, in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ('My Struggle'). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy. By 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, which led to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans—actions which gave him significant popular support. Hitler sought Lebensraum ('living space') for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen ('sub-humans') and socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare, and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history.\",\n",

In 1842, Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois's mother Maria Anna. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler's brother, Johann Nepomuk In 1876, Alois was legitimated and the baptismal register changed by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as 'Georg Alois then assumed the surname 'Hitler',[5] also spelled as Hiedler, Hüttler, or Huettler. The Hitler surname is probably based on 'one who lives in a hut' (German Hütte for Nazi official Hans Frank suggested that Alois's mother had been employed as a housekeeper for a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence,[8] so historians dismiss the claim that Alois's father was Childhood and education Adolf Hitler as an infant (c. 1889–90) Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German He was one of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara Pölzl (1860–1907). Three of Hitler's siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned school) in nearby The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. The death of his younger brother Edmund, who died from measles in 1900, deeply affected Hitler. He changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and Hitler's mother, Klara Hitler's father, Alois Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf stated that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw 'what littl\",\n",

       " 63: [\"This War of Mine is one of the most emotional, grim games I've ever played. There were many moments in this game where I felt absolutley terrible for the things I had to do to survive. WARNING: this is not a happy game in any stretch of the imagination. This is a game about war, and war is hell. Sure there are a couple mildly happy moments in the game, but overhall it's very grim. This War of Mine is a game based on the Seige of Sarajevo that lasted 1,425 days and it is known to be the largest seige of a city in history. You play as a group of civilians trying to survive in a fictional beseiged city called Pogoren. You must deal with starvation, lack of medical supplies, scavangers trying to raid your supplies, and the emotional state of the survivors. One of the best things about this game is the fact that I couldn't reload a previous save to undo a horrible thing I've done, the game only auto saves after every night of scavenging and override's the previous save. This makes it more emmotionally gripping and nail-biting since it makes my decisions perminant and that it made me try even harder to not die. And it's not easy, trust me. There are multiple points in the game where I had little resources and my survivors were either starving, depressed, exausted, freezing, or all of the above. All of the abbandoned buildings were either stripped clean of supplies or didn't have the resources that the survivors needed to, well, survive. There were only 2 options: raid another shelter for supplies or die. I had to rob and/or kill (mostly) innocents for their supplies in order to survive. It's not a walk in the park either, it will be emotionally heavy for both the player (unless they're a psychopath or a sociopath) and their survivors. The one who got to raid and kill the innocents for food and supplies will suffer from severe psychological trauma. And the player will have to deal with that. And due to the trend I've seen when people who review this game tell a story from their experience from the game, I'm going to do that too. There was one day where my survivors were starving, some wounded and/or exausted. They had little resources, their options were limited. They had no choice but to attack another Shelter full of people. Marko, an expert scavenger, couldn't go because he was emmotionally broken from all the people he had to kill in order to survive. Bruno seemed to be the only one capable to go and steal from another shelter, so he was sent to steal supplies from another shelter while Pavle was to gaurd the shelter from looters during the night. When Bruno reached the place, he looked through the peephole and saw a gaurd. He waited when the gaurd wasn't looking. Bruno then equiped his knife and then stabbed the gaurd in the back. This didn't insta-kill him though, so Bruno had to stab him a second time. Bruno then looted the gaurd's corpse and found a shotgun with some ammo. This caused some noise however, and caused a woman to come down from the stairs. The woman was crying out: 'Oh god! Herald, no! No, this can't be happening!' and sat down next to the dead gaurd while sobbing. Bruno couldn't think striaght, he thought it was best to shoot the woman and put her out of her misery. The gunshot alerted two gaurds nearby, they came down and saw the two dead bodies of their comarads. They yelled out 'Murderer!' to Bruno and tried to kill him. Bruno killed the two soldiers but was severely wounded. As he looted their corpses as well as the nearby area with no gaurds, he was soaking in the fact that he just murdered innocent people for food. I felt like crap after doing that, there are many moments like these that the player will encounter during their playthrough. It's depressing but in a good way, if that makes any sense. But the game isn't perfect, the survivors will sometimes say obvious things like 'this shovel is doing while they're digging it. And the controls can be annoying at times, I've accidentally closed doors when I was trying to get through them multiple times in the game. It runs pretty smoothly on my pc, and I haven't noticed any bugs sp far. But the game's flaws hardly take away from the experience. This is by far my game of the year. I give This War of Mine a 10/10. I highly recomend it if you're sick of war games from the point of view from a soldiers perspective and glorifying violence. \",\n",
       "  \"Play this game. For the love of everything you NEED this game in your life. ----SPOILERS---- My first play through was difficult both in game dynamics and mentally for me, the gamer. I lasted three hours. Then Anton, one of my team of three got sick. The second, his name was Bruce, he got stabbed in a raid. They took our medicine, food and bandages and left our friend hurt. Paulo tried to go out and get medicine and bandages, but eventually Anton succumbed to his illness. The two remaining survivors were sad and mourned his death, spending an entire day grieving. That night, Bruce left. No note, no goodbye. Paulo spent that third day sitting alone in the empty house. He wouldn't eat the food, wouldn't sleep in the bed, he just sat there. Crying about the loss of his friends, wondering if he'd ever see his little boy again. I told him, 'Just hold on one more day, maybe things will get better. Maybe tomorrow will be That night Paulo committed suicide. Then I had to sit there, staring blankly at the screen, grieving for three character's I had become so attached to as their 'final words' came across the screen. The first, Bruce, he died from his illness, there was nothing we could do, there was no medicine to be found, it was all taken in the raid. Bruce, well, he left in the middle of the night to go into the city to try and find his family but was betrayed by a trader and killed. He died alone in the city, killed like a dog. And Paulo, he hung himself in the attic because he had lost hope of ever finding his son after the war. That was three hours of game play, I felt like it was a life-time of heart ache. My next play-through I made it and we survived the war, no one died, not a single character, but it cost us. Paulo stole from the elderly couple, because we needed medicine for Anton. We left them some medicine, but we took what we needed while the elderly couple cried and hid in the bathroom, begging Paulo to leave. Anton spent the next three days distrusting Paulo, doubting him. 'Is this what we've become?' The others, they spent those days wondering if the sickly elderly woman would survive. If WE really needed the medicine more then her. We stole, we killed, we offered aid and we survived, and in the end what did we get? Meek stories, stories that felt real. There were no happy endings. Anton was ruined by the war, Paulo? He's still trying to find his son. This game is amazing, and you need it in your life.\",\n",
       "  \"I survived this War of Mine on my first playthrough. Let me tell you a story. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three survivors one day came together and as fate would have it they knew each other, Katia having interviewed Pavle before and Bruno being the host of his own cooking show. Now, no matter their past or skills, they would be reduced to nothing else but scavengers, like everyone else. War torn apart the city of Pagoren instantly, leaving everyone lost, scared and in need of shelter. The first few days, Pavle went out and gathered as much supplies as he could, enough to keep everyone fed by exploring abandonned buildings and trading with their savior Franko, always ready to barter when needed and always looking to help. Katia would negotiate best with him and get the most out of it. One day, a couple kids came to their shelter, demanding bandages for their sick mother, bandages they didn't have. They had to unwillingly turn down the poor children and concentrate on their own survival, although they would have spared the supplies they needed if they had it. Days went by and the children came back soon enough, demanding urgent need of bandages once again. They had to be turned down with a heartfelt 'sorry' for the second time. They came back much later, in dire need of help. Their mother was slowly succumbing to her injuries and needed someone to carry her to the hospital as soon as possible. Of course the group agreed and the mother was saved thanks to their kind gesture. From that day, they would help everyone who needed it and sacrifice their own survival for the needs of others, no matter the cost, their humanity wouldn't be lost. Soon after, a man named Roman who had deserted the militia came in need of shelter, they agreed to let him in and so they had another mouth to feed but another guard for the night. They went through a lot of close calls trying to secure their humanity, it would have been easy for them to just loot the house of other survivors and steal whatever they needed, but they simply wouldn't resort to such atrocities. Instead opting for the much more dangerous routes, cleaning up a warehouse of thugs and bandits, claiming it for their own and avenging the death of Olek the priest at the Church. The first skirmish would prove to be surprisingly easy for Pavle only getting wounded killing the criminals with only a knife in hand. The man felt no remorse for killing such scum of the earth and everyone in the neighborhood felt safer knowing one less group of bandit was wandering around at night. Suffering from his injuries, he would be replaced at night by Katia, having enough space in her inventory to carry the same amount as him. Time would get tougher as war raged on outside, blocking access to many routes and giving them less options to gather supplies. Investigating the Church one night and learning of the fate of priest Olek, she decided to follow Pavle's example and take care of the bandits once and for all and as luck would have it, she did it without suffering any major injuries, axe in hand. The place turned out to be a worthy risk to take and gave them enough supplies to last for a while. Luck would smile on them and with every good deed, came more surprises and hope of better days. Gathering enough supplies from the cleared warehouse and church to reinforce security, secure enough food for days and building an arsenal good enough to ensure their suvival. Books would keep them entertained and the discovery of a broken guitar brought music back into their life, the music of the radio would become redundant at times and everyone but Bruno knew how to play. They even endured the lack of cigarettes and coffee and had plenty to go around. Lady Luck was truly upon them. Then Winter even more territories to explore and once again making options thinner. One night, while out scavenging for wood and supplies at the construction site, an almost fatal encounter for Pavle arised and the army almost shot him down, wounding him severely and causing him to be bed Katia took over meanwhile and did her best to gather all the supplies they needed. Heating up the shelter became a priority and everything else would be gained through trade and barter. Thankfully for them, it was her specialty. She kept them fed, safe and secure for most of winter, that is until she was injured too while on a For a time, Roman took the job over, which wasn't easy since his bag wouldn't carry as much as both Pavle and Katia, who would remain bedridden for most of the remaining The times were tough but helping other survivors ensured them enough to survive winter and the harsh time, building two heaters to last during the cold season and harvesting as much fuel as possible at both the church and construction site. Most routes would be blocked due to snow and the options were few and far they still wouldn't resort to commiting any atrocities towards other fellow survivors. The part of town that was closed previously became once again available as snow slowly started melting and the promise of unexplored territories became accessible once again. They would loot everything the town had to offer and when the surge of crime came around, they had enough to reinforce doors, keep themselves fed, healthy and stocked on weapons and ammunition. Which would still be a challenge for them in the end, having looted most of the town and having less and less options for survival, yet they still wouldn't resort to commiting crimes or murder. Times became tougher, but they decided to built a small trap to ensure enough food to go around. Crimes became more violent throughout the city of Pagoren and the times became more than had almost no options left and they still wouldn't resort to the easier options, sacrificing their humanity wasn't an option. Much worse, ammo was running out and the insurance of protection during nightime became more and more of an urgency. Yet, they somehow managed to survive through it all, through bartering with settlements instead of stealing from them, risking their lives when needed and sparing the innocents, the declaration of ceasefire came around the corner. They had made it. All of them, through thick and thin. We had survived, This War of Mine. More importantly, we had retained our humanity. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stories like these are rare and this one will be treasured by me forever. I believe that no matter the sacrifices, helping each other out in times of need is better than being at each other's throat. War is ugly, War never changes, yet, war is sadly a necessary evil, without it, someone is bound to start one anyway and the cycle will never only it didn't exist or at least wasn't an option. This War of Mine is one of the best Anti-War game i've played in my life, portraying the true casualties of war and the people that simply tried to survive through it, fighting for simple survival, day after day. I bought the DLC and i'm glad to know that the money will go to those who need it, no matter the sum, its a worthy cause. 11/10 would survive and fight to retain my humanity once again.\",\n",
       "  \"Pavle never came home from his run last night. No one said anything when he didnt return, but it was understood. Pavle was never late, he always returned just as the morning light crept over the ruins of our dear city. But not this morning, this morning he never came back, and it was understood. A deep meloncholy had washed over the survivors safe house, for with Pavle died their last chance for survival. The others were too sick, too battered and broken to move. They would die here. Death was preferable, Marko thought as he lay bleeding on the couch. The deep wound in his side had opened over night, and without bandages, he would be dead before night came again. 'I never should have gone', he thought to himself. Two nights prior Marko had made a run to a small apartment building just south of the survivors safe house. He knew an elderly couple and their son were still living there, but he figured he could be in and out with enough food to last his group a few days. But his plan was flawed. The elderly woman had seen him and called to her son, who swiftly charged at Marco with a knife. Before he could react, the son was on him, the knife sunk into his side. But Marko was strong, and his flight from that apartment proved as much. When he arrived back at their decrepid domicile, the others rushed to his aide. 'Sleep my friend, we dont need to make a run tonight'. Pavle had always been a kind man. A football player before the war, he had a rough exterior that hid the kindness in his heart. He was a good man. But it was cold, and they were hungry. So as night fell, Pavle took the handgun they had managed to steal from the military base, and made his way back to the small apartment. 'Im not going to hurt anyone', Pavle thought to himself as he crept along the ruined city streets. 'In and out, if they see me, ill threaten them with He held the gun close to himself. It was his dearest companion, his lone friend in what was to come. The apartment was quiet as he crept inside. Perhaps, he thought, the family had fled after the scare they got from Marko last night. As he made his way into the kitchen, he noticed a picture on the wall. The family that lived here; the picture showed happier times. Pavle missed his own family, who had been seperated from him in the early days of the siege. He planned to find them just as soon as he could, and he felt great pangs of regret as he wondered what they would think if they saw him now. He was lost in thought, so much so that he didnt hear the soft footsteps behind him. All he heard was a shrill scream, and the shots being fired from his own gun. The old woman lie dead before him, shot 3 times in the chest. Pavle was shocked, he hadnt meant to do it, he was startled and afraid. 'MOM!?!?' The sound of footsteps grew louder, but Pavle couldnt move. He had to explain himself, had to make things right. The son entered the kitchen, staring at his mothers corpse. Pavle tried to speak, but only dull murmers escaped him. 'Im The son shook his head, tears streaming down his face. He closed his eyes and raised the shotgun he was carrying, leveling it with Pavles heart. 'Im Pavle never came home last night. No one saw him leave, but it was understood. He had taken the survivors only gun, and returned to the small apartment to take what he could. He was gone now though, it was understood. Marko could hear Bruno weeping upstairs. He had spoken earlier of taking his own life, and Marko no longer had the energy to stop him. So he lay there bleeding; waiting for whatever came next. 'At least', he thought to himself,'I have some time to This war had ruined them, just as it had ruined their dear city. They were broken, desperate, and soon they would be dead. Why had Pavle taken the gun? What did he intend to do? He had to have known what would happen if he went back there. How did it come to this, how did they fall so far? They were good men, Pavle was a good man. Right? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Inspired by the siege of Sarajevo in the Bosnian civil war, This War of Mine is a strategy game made by 11BitGames, best known for their 'Anomaly' series. In it, players take control of a group of survivors struggling to survive in the ruins of a besieged modern day city. Over the course of the game, players are forced into the murcky gray plain of moral relativity, doing what they must to survive. I have no desire to spoil anything for you, dear reader, so ill leave it at this. Buy this game. It should be played by every person the world over, especially those who think of war as sport, far removed from the horrors it contains. It's heavy, it's dark, and it doesnt pull its punches, but it is an experience worth having for anyone who sees video games as an art form. Can you survive the siege?\",\n",
       "  \"there were two men in my little hovel, a cook named bruno and runner named pavle. bruno would normally stay at home during the night to cook and guard the belongings while pavle went out scavenging for supplies, but that previous night pavle had been shot while sprinting across a courtyard trying to make it to the abandoned side of a building complex for any chance of food. they were both hungry. pavle survived and made it back (there was no food to be found), but it was clear that bruno would need to leave the shelter to find food and bandages while pavle nursed his wounds. even though it was likely dangerous, the best bet seemed a run down supermarket. shelling from the war had closed off any safer avenues. while sifting through toppled shopping carts and piles of rubble, bruno heard a confrontation in an adjoining room: a young woman was also there looking for food, but had been accosted by an armed man. his implication was clear: he had the food, so she had to do what he wanted. she sounded so hungry. bruno (and by extension, i) was unable to ignore it, even though he had literally brought only a knife to a gun fight. maybe he could sneak up behind him before he noticed. as soon as the door behind him opened, the girl yelled and ran through it, leaving bruno crouched, exposed, in full view of her attacker. a single gunshot later, and bruno was dead. at that moment, i wondered something very dark: the woman had escaped, but she was still hungry. perhaps she starved to death, because of my intervention. perhaps she, through a horror i don't even want to acknowledge, would have indeed received food from her attacker. perhaps he would have simply killed her. there was no way to know. pavle awoke alone the next morning. at this point my videogame urge to just start over with new characters and resources was strong, but i kept playing. i was forced to make more difficult, tense choices for survival, sacrifices, and calculated risks in a way that i would have never experienced if i'd taken the easy way out. pavle is still alive and alone, many days later. a man arrived wanting to trade shortly after bruno died, and pavle gave him almost everything of value in the shelter (including his lucky shovel) for a tin of food and some bandages. he arrives home, dejected, each morning to the unguarded, almost undoubtedly ransacked shelter. a man on the radio mentions that tobacco is currently in high demand, so pavle spent his entire morning rolling cigarettes with the spoils of last night's haul. maybe he can find someone tonight willing to trade. maybe they'll have food.\"],\n",

      "This game is I love it. I can't stop playing. It's so easy to lose track of time. I've played 11+ hours and it felt like I only played for 5 hours. People will say it's like minecraft and other games similar but don't knock it till you try it. It's worth the money and I like that you can play with friends. I currently don't have anyone who I know playing this yet, so I have yet to explore the adventure with others. The art style is just sooo cute. I love the slimes the best. This game starts of super cute and fun with the slimes, bunnies and pigs but go into the wrong portal and hell awaits. I think it's a fun way to explore diffrent places and a good way to test how good you are at the game. It may be a little sad when you die and you got so far but each time you play you get better and better. Just don't stay still for a long will face the horrible fate that has come across you.\n",
      "If the retail price was $1, I'd recommend it - on a sale. I got it in a bundle myself, so that's fine. (Edit: Well, look at that, just saw that it's $1 now. So I'm changing the Recommendation to 'Yes', as long as you get it at 75% off or better) It's a first person shooter with 11 or 12 short levels and no mid-level checkpoints, if you die you have to start the level over. If you quit, you can restart from the first levels that you've gotten to. Some levels are really frustrating, but again they're short. Gameplay is below average - moving around feels 'floaty' and guns feel like toys, but can be ok for some surreal fun and challenge. And as said above, the game is pretty challenging, and is more about dodging the enemies long enough to kill them than 1337 shooting skillz - since the enemies are pretty big and headshots don't count. And of course platforming, because who doesn't like platforming in the first person? So if you just want a good challenge behind a bad FPS, maybe this game is for you. Took me 100 minutes to beat and watch the credits.\n",
      "Previously I wrote a review about this game of how I didn't like it. I put the thumbs down for it and called it a day. I have now played though 4 of the 5 Blackwell games (the four that come in a bundle) and would now say that I was relatively pleased with the series. The first game was on a very small budget as Wadjet Eye games was just starting out (the only other game out was The Shivah). I have left my old review up about this game. And while I still dislike many of the elements of the first installment, this game does lay the ground work for some fun future installments and a pretty good series. I give the series a overall. Old Review: I wish there was a maybe button for reviews. I personally did not enjoy the game very much. There were too many things that I did not like about it. Some might like the style and actually enjoy the game, so here were my pro's and con's. Pro's: Good storyline, Interesting Characters Con's: Puzzles were too easy, only two functions for the game (not like a classic point and click, Look At, Pick Up, Push, Pull, Talk To), the game was too short, and the art was not that great (game looked like it was made in the 1990's instead of 2006, but look at the pictures and decide for yourself). Some people love shorter games with easier puzzles. And if you really like mystery, then this might be the game for you. I myself like to figure out how to use the 'rubber chicken with the pulley in the Check out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!\n",
      "Binding of Isaac has become one of my favourite indie games and there is no surprise why: Starting a new game I was already amused by the classic 'room battles' with almost a different foe each time. When reaching my first treasure rooms I felt a sense of satisfaction that I was being rewarded for my progress, the item I collected not only transformed my abilities but transformed isaac himself! I instantly knew that I needed these items to survive this game let alone improve my character, making looting a very important part of the game. After my exploring and looting I finally came across to the boss room and in turn, my first challenge! Although this was the first room therefore the easiest boss, I felt a little helpless as it was my first encounter and had no idea what this boss was capable of which made the fight much more exciting for me. Unfortunately my first playthrough was cut short in the second stage (stupid pointers getting a lucky shot). Starting up a second playthrough I noticed the changes straight away, the levels were completely different from the first! The layout of the floor, items rewarded, even the boss had completely changed! This is what makes Binding of Isaac so addicting for me, it's never the same twice. Now I've covered the experience playing the game yet I still have so much to talk about! Being run on flash it works ridiculously well; there is rarely any lag at all and I can't say that I've witnessed any crashes or glitches, you can tell this game was very well put together and a large amount of effort and care was put into making this the perfect indie game. Another part of the game is the beautiful music, oh the music! Words are not enough to tell you guys how much I love this soundtrack; its simple yet catchy tune when exploring the first floor, fast-paced battle theme that really gets you in the mood for victory! I love how eerie and darker the music starts to get as you progress further down the basement. There's not one negative thing that can be said about this soundtrack. Hat's off to you, Dan! Personally, after getting to know the back story of this game (not saying anything about it because spoilers) this has really got me to tell my mother how much I love her :( displays that games can hit you on a much deeper level. I've been playing Binding of Isaac now for at least half a year, I've achieved so much and beaten the game many times, I've even brought Wrath of The Lamb Expansion (but a review on that is for another day). But I still think that I've not fully 'completed' the game therefore I'm still enjoying it as much as I did on my first playthrough, no matter how many times I click on the 'start' button :) So the question is this: would I recommend this game to be played by any kind of gamer and not just indie lovers? Its a big fat yes, this will be the best you'll ever spend on steam!\n",

This will probably change in the future, but I guess you don't want to hold your breath until then. So please use the Steam Refund function, and please accept my That's from October. It's January now. The game is still on the store for Mac and Linux. You can open the menu, but you can't click on any options. When asked to take the Mac version down from the store (since it is unplayable), the developer has this to say: 'I understand your gripes, but I'm pretty sure I'm already delivering a way better support than most large studios and publishers do. So please let's not make a mountain out of a molehill. Most OSX users can play the game just fine, and for those who can't I'll come up with a solution, but just not now. So for the moment I suggest using the refund function, and maybe leave an angry review. But stopping sale alltogether seems like overkill to No, gnarf. You are not delivering 'way better support'. You're not providing *any* support. So here's your angry review, and now it's time to refund the game. We aren't 'making a mountain out of a molehill'. You are selling an unplayable game. That's kind of a big deal. Sucks too, cause this game looks like a lot of fun. And yes, I know I could just dual-boot, play in Windows. But you promised that it worked on Mac and Linux. It does not. It's the principle of the thing.\n",
      "I'm trying so hard to like this game but it's just making me so frustrated. I have a mac thats close to five years old and I did in fact see that there were problems with older macs and whatnot. I did manage to get it to work but it was super laggy to the point were I just gave up because i couldn't do anything. I figured that it was probably just because I have an older mac and that it would work on my family's shared computer which has Windows. Same thing. Had to close it a couple of times because I would get a black screen and when I finally did manage to play the game I got the same thing I did last time. Major lag. So either there's something wrong with both of my computers or theres something wrong with the game. I'm trying to redownload it for the third time to see if that will make it work better but as of now I'm pretty irratated. The game has a great soundtrack from what little I heard of it, it has a very unique and interesting style and concept that goes along with it, but as someone who can't get past 6 minutes of playtime without it going wonky I'm fed up with it. If there's anyone that knows whats wrong or has any suggestions I'd love to hear them but for now I'm not going to be touching this game for a while.\n",

      "Many people call Enter the Gungeon the better Isaac or Nuclear Throne and in many ways it is. The game features better combat than Isaac though in my opinion it's not quite on the level of Nuclear Throne and has more item variety and more guns than Nuclear Throne even though Isaac beats Enter the Gungeon in this aspect as it has more items that have more unique synergies. So it's a decent mix between Isaac and Nuclear Throne and takes advantage of some good aspects of both of those titles. If you like those games, Enter the Gungeon is an easy buy. The presentation is great, the combat is good. But here are some of the problems: Just like Isaac some runs you're going to get screwed by RNG and either get useless guns or run out of ammo for your good guns in no time. But in Isaac you can often redeem your bad run by playing well and getting a deal with the devil which will, mostly, provide you with great items. Gungeon is different. Many guns might be cool for 5 minutes while you figure out what they do but after that period of time is over you're left with a gun that feels useless against most bosses. There aren't any OP items/guns in the same way as there are in Isaac. On the one hand this makes the game more skill-reliant but on the other hand this makes the combat feel frustrating in many cases since basic enemies on later levels often take 6-8 hits from your AK-47. The problem is: the enemies' HP scales based on the level you are on which makes the combat progressively more frustrating as you play. For example: on the first level an AK-47 takes down basic enemies in 3 hits, while on the fourth floor the same enemy takes twice as many hits from the gun. Not only does this make you feel like your guns are useless, but it also causes you to run out of ammo frequently and thusly forcing you to either use a bad gun or your even worse starting weapon. I have no problems with later enemies having more HP, but the same enemies having progressively more HP based on the level you are on is a cheap way of increasing difficulty in my opinion. The solution to this is easy: just remove the HP-scaling and the combat will feel better and your ammo won't run out as frequently. The game might be easier as result but it won't be too easy as it very difficult even without scaling HP. And more importantly: It would be more fun. Overall I still think the game is good since the gameplay is fun, there is a lot of weapon variety and the art style is very well executed. I just wish some of the guns would feel more powerful and HP-scaling wasn't a thing. If that were the case, I would happily jump on the It's-Better-Than-Isaac-Hype-Train. As it is currently, I would recommend it to fans of the rogue-lite genre but those who haven't played The Binding of Isaac or Nuclear Throne, I'd recommend those titles over this one.\n",
      "I would like to make clear that I only got the free version of this game so my experience related within this review can only be based upon the free version and none of the paid versions of the game. Four words desricbe this tummy bannana rub' (I could do it in less words, but not here) stars for the free version, the need to be super awesome or pay money to get more weps to strip is why I rate it down a bit Other than that I enjoyed my gun tummy bannana rub. Mainly because I have stripped and re-assembled various models of the AK-47 and M1911 and put them back together lots as a child. MODELS! not real ones! The ingenuity of the mechanisms in guns has always astonished me. This game shows all that engineering genius in the simplicity of the working parts in reasonably good detail, static and functioning. There is also a shooting range that is unlockable through experience earned or bought. One gripe from me, is that some pieces would not let me dissasemble them before I took apart another unrelated was no logical reason why I could not remove that part. This has happened in both the first two weapons and makes playing the super game mode more a 'Learn what order your taught to do it' rather than ' I got a screwdriver and there is a screw, I should be able to take it out now' You are then left with the looming fact that unless you learn those first 3 guns inside out and the correct order to do EVERYTHING you are going to have to pay money to get more guns. Oh, there is a 'Bonus' part where you can dissasemble a human in a gun game ? What? well, I done it anyway and put it back together again hoping to get enough experience to unlock something .. but no, it was not to be. 300XP didn't put a dent the 5000XP I needed for the next gun. There are other are cars. As that last bit was totally confusing, we are just going to move on with the gun stuff. The question is , how much do you like guns? the first is an AK-47 and then a M1911. These weapons are a pleasure to strip and put back together (for me anyways) I do have a personal favourite that I am tempted to get,,, it looks like it will cost me a fiver though :( For me, I personally would really only get enjoyment out of weapons I am familair with. Last words are this, Try it, its actually educational and seeing the brutal simplicity of a death dealing tool in action is quite something.\n",
      " Edit and clarification below The day has finally come, I backed this game back on Kickstarter close to 3 years ago and IT'S HERE I have been eagerly anticipating the release of this game forever and BOY does it deliver. First things first, don't go into SUPERHOT expecting a lengthy and 'mind blowing' story. I have seen quite a few reviews from people criticizing the game because 'the story is 2 hours'. I for one love the short story, it has a Cronenberg 'Videodrome' vibe (especially when you hunt for the numerous secrets). After finishing the campaign you unlock tons of endless and challenge modes as well as hidden secrets within all the levels. This is where the meat of the game lies. There are also a handful of mini games in the menu that are quite entertaining. If you have seen any gameplay you know what to expect. This IS a 'one trick pony' as they say. However, this one trick is executed with perfection . The aesthetic of this game is just gorgeous, the sound design is superb, the art style is crisp and clean, the DOS era theme of the game menus is very polished, and the controls are as tight as can be. 'Killstagram' (Now called 'SUPERHOT Video' for PC reasons I imagine) is also a really sweet and unique feature. You can seamlessly upload replays in game to / to be shared on social media. All in all this is a fantastic game, I am a big fan of endless games and I will be putting many of hours into this. Easily one of my favorite FPS games. BODIES ARE DISPOSABLE GIVE US NAMES GIVE US YOUR FRIENDS WE NEED MORE OBEY SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT EDIT: Right, alot of downvotes because I am not bashing the game with an ignorant and/or snarky three sentence review. Let me clarify, I could care less whether or not you like the game. However, it is common knowledge that the game is a score attack/mechanic driven game. So, when you buy and then write a 'wtf 2 hours for 25 dollars!1!1' negative review you are making yourself look like a fool, and perpetuating a fallacy. I agree SUPERHOT isn't for everyone. As I stated before, complaining the story wasn't long enough AFTER FULLY KNOWING IT IS AIMED AT ENDLESS AND CHALLENGE MODES is utterly absurd. SUPERHOT was funded for the SOLE purpose of having tons of endless and challenge modes. If people bashing the game bothered to research before purchasing they would have known this. If you even did a quarter of the challenges available you would get your moneys worth. Criticizing a game for what it isn't trying to be is the very definition of entitlement. I legitimately haven't seen a vaild criticism of the game yet besides 'hurr durr it's 2 hours'. Look at the description, it doesn't even mention a campaign. This game is probably one of the best to come from crowdfunding, it delivered EXACTLY what the backers wanted. At the end of the day whether or not it is worth the price is dependent on what you think of the time slowing mechanic. If you saw the mechanic and went 'meh' you will be bored probably within three hours. If you were fascinated by a revolutionary step in an otherwise stagnant FPS genre seeing thousands of opportunities, you will be occupied for HOURS. EDIT 2: I have never been one to take Steam reviews as the gospel. Especially now after seeing all the negative 2 sentence snarky reviews getting thrust to the top of the SUPERHOT page. I am very glad that the critical reception has been very positive. However, in the user Steam reviews I have seen a vocal minority insulting the dev's artistic vision, questioning their character, even going as far as to call them 'disingenuous'. Frankly, it is really childish to me to hate a game just because it wasn't what you expected. I wish the team the best of luck and I hope they make enough cash to embark on another endeavor, they deserve it.\n",
      "Gungeon is the kind of game that other people are going to scrutinize and say 'But if I've already got The Binding of Isaac, I don't need to play this one, dude!' Stop. Put that thought out of your head. Isaac and Gungeon are two entirely different beasts. Isaac's game is structured and fractal, asking you to play the game many, many times in different forms and with different characters to reach 'the true ending'. Gungeon's game is more straightforward - you have a dude, and that dude wants to get the gun to kill his past, and there's a giant pit between you and that gun that is filled with adorable bullets that use guns to shoot bullets at you. There's also shotgun shells that use shotguns to shoot shotgun pellets for you. There's also a knight with a sword, but he uses the sword to shoot bullets at you. There's also a skeleton made out of bullet casings, but he shoots you with lasers. Basically, this game is incredibly adorable, but you must not drop your gun and hug the smiling bullets or you will get shot by the bullets shooting bullets at you. It's complicated, but less so, because it's all about getting to the end game (there is a sub-quest where you have to construct a bullet for the gun that kills your past, but that's about it). In both games, you can coast if you manage to put together a good loadout! In Gungeon, getting a good loadout requires a bit of luck and knowing which guns are best for which situations. Some guns are best for crowds of enemies, some guns are best for bosses, some guns are just jokes in gun form, and some guns will go through all of your ammo before you know it. You'll eventually know which ones are best through usage and experience. There's also the issue of Mastery - in Gungeon, you start out with three hearts, like a Zelda. But unlike Zelda, if you are fortunate enough to defeat a boss without taking a hit, you earn an extra heart container. You take one bullet, and you can kiss that heart container goodbye. You will lose a lot (like you would in a proper Roguelike) before you manage to win one time, but oh man, if you make it, you can shoot a dragon in the face! Medieval people never got the opportunity to do that. You are blessed. You were born in the right generation. The soundtrack and the graphics are aces. Doseone's soundtrack is at the same time incredibly energetic and subliminally hypnotic, fitting the weird gun dungeon to a T. The graphics are pixel graphics, but they're the really neat, detailed kind. That won't stop sad nerds and millenials from crying about how pixel graphics are the bane of their existence inbetween emailing developers and publishers about how they should 'get a graphics department'. If I had to suggest something for the game to knock off and stop doing: The referential humor gets a bit much at times. I appreciate a good reference to other video games and I definitely know that if you don't have the AK-47 in a game that's all about how many guns it has, you're not doing your job right. But some of the video game guns are just plain references and that's kind of lazy. Plus, a universe where there's bullets that use guns to shoot bullets is kind of the bonkers universe that needs to be expanded upon! Gungeon's great. There's a gun that is called a Microtransaction gun and it just shoots items from collector's editions of video games into the faces of your enemies. So if you've ever wanted to kill someone by throwing your overpriced figurine from that video game you like so much, now's your chance, weirdo.\n",

      " Gameplay: It's okay, but feels a little thin. Using a shotgun and certain abilities feels pretty satisfying, but the melee combat is pretty bland. It lacks the depth of a good roguelike, and there are certain things that keep it from having the flow they were looking for. The crafting system seems big and complicated, but honestly I don't care enough about it to really want to use it. The story mode is pretty boring and honestly not that great from what I've seen so far. Endless mode is a bit more but for that, I feel like I have a dozen games that do this type of thing 10x better. Controls/UI: It feels like it was made for consoles/tablets first, and haphazardly ported to PC. You can't rebind the controls, and if you want to use a controller, you have to go edit filenames to make sure the included controller preset file for your type of controller is named and you better hope they included a preset for your controller, since there are only like 4 availible. I'm not kidding. This is VERY LAZY on the developer's part, and I imagine some users who aren't so great with computers will struggle with this. In-game menu, please! Is that so much to ask? The keyboard controls are wiggity-whack. Why can't 'I' be inventory? E for equipment? Q or L for Questlog? S or K for skills? You know, like most roguelike/lite games? You can move with QWEASDZC, the numpad, the mouse, or the left-stick on the controller. Facing different directions is easy enough on controller, since you just use the right-stick, but to turn with the keyboard you have to hold space and press a direction. It's very clunky. I hear an update is coming soon that will allow users to rebind via (you guessed it!) an INI file. ugh. IN. GAME. MENU. PLEASE. The controls are much more bearable with my 360 controller during actual gameplay, but are slow and annoying to use in the inventory menus. The UI is full of big buttons, and menus that pop out of the sides of the screen. It looks like a tablet game. You have 3 levels of zoom. 'way too close' 'okay, but I'd like to zoom out maybe just a little' and 'way too far away' Sound: The sounds and music are pretty good. Not great, not just alright. Graphics: Kinda pre-rendered 3D-esque nice shaders and effects. It looks pretty nice, though sometimes walls and other objects on the terrain just get in the way of me seeing what I'm doing. The graphics are one of this game's strongest but sometimes the big sprites and terrain objects are just too much. In Wait and see if the devs get their act together on the and maybe see if it goes on sale or something. At this time, I wouldn't recommend it. Certainly not at full price.\n",
      "Play it with a controller 8/10\n",
      "I remember playing this game when I was kid! It was a blast to sit in front of the TV late at night with my buddies trying over and over again to get our fearless hero, Abe, through a variety of puzzles and fun obstacles. The reboot, is no different. The game itself looks great and offers me that same excitement or at least it would if the game worked with my controller. I have a Logitech F310 controller that works great with most games, and I assumed it would work with New n Tasty. No dice. I saw on the games page that it had full controller support; but neglected to see that they meant Xbox controllers only. Is that really full controller support? Isn't that partial controller support? I later found out they were working on a fix to add additional controller support to include mine. Great! I played through most of the game on a mouse and keyboard, but found the game play more irritating than enjoyable. In my opinion, this game needs to be played with a controller. That's how it was originally designed when it was released in the 90's. When the patches came, my controller still didn't work. I sent an email to support to see if they would help me. No response. I waiting for the second patch that insisted that it fixed all controller issues. Still no improvement. Another patch came out that would let gamers remap the controls if they could get into the game files and then write out the code. I WOULD NEVER HAVE PAID MONEY FOR A GAME I HAD TO PARTIALLY DEVELOP SIMPLY TO GET IT TO WORK. There's has been another bug fixed released that promises it fixes all of my troubles but it doesn't. In fact, I'm pretty sure it did nothing at all. The developers have been nothing short of rude and unhelpful by not responding to my inquires and not offering me a refund for an incomplete game. In short: This whole experience has wasted my time, money and patience. It's a sad rip off of what was once my favorite game.\n",

      "Most people have heard of the infamous 'bird dating simulator' because the premise well, seemingly ridiculous. You play as the only human in a school of birds and the object of the game is to form meaningful relationships with them. Yep, that's right, you're gonna pull yourself some sweet pigeon booty. Coo Coo. It seriously feels like a parody on the dating sim genre at best. The writing is mediocre at best with most of the birds being just as much as an oddball as the main character. The birds personalities do fall flat at time, but what really ties the game together is the 'true ending' which can only be obtained by playing through every bird's route. The true ending manages to effortlessly weave the links between all of the birds and Hiyko together leading to a story that has twists, surprises and tearjerking moments. The conclusion is satisying and enough to convince me that although this is a game with a ridiculous concept, it's meant to be taken seriously and not as the joke as it seems. Overall, Hatoful Boyfriend is a quirky game with a colourful cast of birds to romance and with enough twists and turns to remain fresh for every playful. The ability to fast forward through scenes is much appreciated and the game isn't a joke, no matter how hard it seems like one.\n",
      "Like many, I was touched by Freebird Games' first game 'To The Moon', one of the most emotional games I have ever played. So how does 'A Bird Story' stack up compared to that game? As you have probably already seen in the screenshots, both games are made in RPGmaker. Most people either love or hate RPGmaker games, personally I do not really care as long as the game is good. Aside from the graphics, A Bird Story does differ a lot from To The Moon. The first difference is the length of the game, To The Moon was not a very long game but it still was a lot longer than A Bird Story, which only should take you one hour to complete. Second difference is there are no conversations, unlike To The Moon where you would get sucked in the story, A Bird Story takes on a different, more art-like story. The third difference is that A Bird Story is a 'feel good' game and no tearjerker like To The Moon. So yes, both games differ quite a lot from each other, which is not a bad thing. Both games are good in their own way, you just should not expect a game like To The Moon, even though it has some moments that reminds you of To The Moon. Overall 'A Bird Story' is recommended to anyone who enjoys 'art' games and want a nice 1-hour experience. \n",
      "I personally don't even know why I like this game. I don't know if it's the fact that everyone is a bird exept you, or that it's a freaking bird dating sim, or just the fact that Okusan knows WING ATTACK, but I just really like this game. It has a bunch of bird puns, lots of comedy, and everything is around birds! The only thing that I kinda don't like is the save feature, but there really isn't anything that can be done about that. So, if you are bored and have nothing to do, get this game, as you will really enjoy it.\n",
      "As much as i liked 'to the moon' i would like to recommend 'a bird story' too, but sadly i can´t. I really tried to like this game - well, it´s more of an interactive movie (and you don´t really have that much interaction either) - but i just can´t. It doesn´t feel right. !!!SPOILER!!! You sit in front of the monitor and you see the story about a little boy, who is alone almost all of the time because his mother seems to work a lot or whatever and he doesn´t have any friends either. But then he finds and rescues this little bird and helps him ro recover from his injury. They become 'friends'. And as you can allready guess, he can´t keep the bird and so the story begins and is almost at the end allready. ! Spoiler end ! pros and cons about it: + great soundtrack + great visuals + good story + emotional - very short (i needed just 70 minutes to 'finish' it) - kind of boring (you barely do anything at all other than dont get me wrong, it´s a good 'game' for those who liked to the moon or similar games, but a birds story doesn´t feel as statisfying as to the moon when you have finished it. It feels like there should be 'more'. Or at least something else. TDLR: 'A Birds Story' is like the foreplay. You started to get in the mood and really looked forward to some awesome enjoyable experience but then, right when you think it is about to happen, it ends. that´s it. Atleast for me. My expections did not get fullfilled.\n",

      "First of all, a little story 'bout buyin' it. I bought the game on Winter Sale, cause I neede some game to compare with Orion Prelude (let's be clear: something to say 'You know, the Orion is not cool, but *game name* is really awesome') And with this think I bought Dino D-Day. When I started it, I got not bad plot. It was a little trashy and irrealistic, but that's the thing I liked in it. Not even a history book will tell us a story about Hitler who created GdDmnd DINOSAURS! Wat the hell? - Thought I and got that this thing is very little (cause there's no campaign and the idea won't be developed more) and funny aspect of this game. What is evident that it's another CS:S clone with changed models and they ask money for this. But IMHO dat game is interesting firstly because of classes and some variety of weapons to choose from (yeah, it's not Borderlands or TF2, but it's something) and Dinosaurs. Nothing special, not so much things that could be described by 1000 and more words, but Dino D-Day is 'quite' game. I mean it made with a plenty of love and wish of creators to make a good game :) Personally, I recommend it for everyone who wishes to play CS:S with Dinos and will not be made to pay extra money Do you hear me, Orion? By the way, I didn't mention this game in that review, if you're interested (but this game, if you ask me, more playable that OP) , cause if we'll compare this 2 games, we'll get that Dino D-Day is featureless game, but made good and nice-optimyzed, while we have absolutely different situation with O:P Have a nice day, pals. I hope I didn't offend anyone, but if it's so, sorry.\n",
      "This is a huge improvement on the first Primal Carnage game. In fact, this is one of the best dinosaur/fighting games, I've ever played! Other than ORION: Prelude, I don't know of very many dinosaur games that have both options to play as humans and dinosaurs. Also, the graphics, animations, models, textures, and sound effects are extremely awesome! The new Acrocanthosaurus is awesome, too! The more dinosaurs, the marrier! And I really love that some of the game modes (Dino Deathmatch, at least) actually allow you to play as a dinosaur and still fight other dinosaurs, like in the prehistoric times! It gives the dinosaurs a bigger challenge! I haven't played the first Primal Carnage, but I've heard that it doesn't allow you to play as a dinosaur and fight other dinosaurs, like in Extinction. And if that's true, I think that's one of the major advantages Primal Carnage Extinction has over the first Primal Carnage. I completely recommend this game for any gamer who loves dinosaurs!\n",
      "It's not so surprising that this game doesn't have a lot of players. At first, the prospect of fighting with friends against hordes of dinosaurs sounds very fun and exciting. Unfortunately, it gets old really fast. The first game you play will probably be the most fun you have with Orion: Dino Horde and then afterwards the novelty wears off. The game has a variety of multiplayer modes but only 2 or 3 that are actively played. Every game rewards you with EXP to increase your level but you don't recieve anything when you increase in level. The content that you experience at level 0 will be the same at the level cap. The game mode that has the most potential for fun is Rampage. Rampage is a Human vs Dinosaur game mode in which players are allowed to play as the dinosaurs alongside AI controlled dinosaurs. It's just unfortunate that right from the get go, the dinosaur team can play as any dinosaur. Right from the beginning of the match, all dinosaur players can select the strongest dinosaurs available like the T-Rex. But all of that is moot because the human team has the overwhelming advantage. Humans can, with upgraded jumps and jetpacks, reach the highest mountain and rain down hell on the dinosaur players. Most of the playable dinosaurs are land based and don't have the ability to jump. The T-Rex has a ranged attack, but with limited distance and a small hitbox. There are a few flying dinosaurs, but they are all too weak to do any considerable damage. The balance issues between human and dinosaur are a result of all the maps being open environments with high peaks. A close quarters indoor environment reminiscient of Jurassic Park would have made for exciting matches and would give more opportunities to using some of the smaller dinosaurs and still be effective. On to the graphics. One word? Meh. The maps are nice enough. Though they suffer from plain textures and too much bloom. Most times you won't even notice the art because there's really nothing to draw your eye to it. Dinosaur models are okay. But player models are just terrible. The low poly and muddy textured player models look like they've been copied from the original Tribes game. The graphics are not a good show of what the Unreal 3 engine can do. Considering I bought the game on a sale, I can't complain, but this is not a well made game. It runs on the gimmick of fighting dinosaurs but ends up being boring and just genuinely not fun. I wouldn't recommend it.\n",
      "I really love this game. The graphics, atmosphere, weapons, tactics, co-op, multiplayer, dinosaurs, and every other things are really awesome. This game reminds of Crysis sometime and other games too because this game is almost like it, halo, KF and others but having dinosaurs! You cannot only kill dinosaurs, you can also become a dinosaurs (rampage mode) which makes this game great fun to play with your friend. I started off with the DM mode which was quite good and after that I was basically playing survival mode with my friends, it was fun chasing the small dinosaurs, flying dinos, huge dinos, and others. I really recommend this game - the developers put alot of effort into this game. Really this game is not really worth I should've spend more money on this!\n",

      "So let me begin by saying that this really isn't much of a game so much as it is a light novel. What Sakura Spirit is, is simply a lot of well drawn images mixed with a lot of text. I have to give the artists credit with their ability to draw, but other than that there isn't much else. Let's start with the story. It starts off interestingly enough and yes I read all of it. There is one choice in this manga that you can make and it doesn't really have much of an impact, in fact it just shows your a different point of view. The most you're going to have to do is really read and click. That's it. Each of the characters do have their own quirks and characteristics but it's really hard to translate who the characters are with still images and text so it leaves a lot to the player to make connections to the characters themselves. Overall though, the story itself is mostly just a male fantasy with a bunch of girls continually hitting on you and you really have no option but to take it and really do nothing about it. It's pretty linear, straightforward and it's not exactly executed well. The fact that you never really see the male protagonist, who is named and already has a personality really breaks player immersion as well, contributing to the aspect that this isn't a game. Visuals: Okay now this is where this manga's strong points really are. Every image is well drawn, and really pretty. You can tell the artists had fun drawing the characters in different poses but there isn't enough. My major quirk is that this isn't animated. It's a lot of still frames with a few scenes having the same characeter with the three different progessional still frames to show them in different states. But most of the time its just a single still frame. The art could have been really amazing if they had animated the scenes, granted it would have been A LOT more work, but at the same time it's something that you should be prepared to put in while you're working on a game or if your art in general is going to be the fundamental focus of your game. Gameplay. Overall if they made this more actiony, gave the player more freedom in choices and some cool combat, this would actually be a game, and I could see it as being something entertaining. There would be a break in the constant slow pace of reading through paragraphs of dialogue and allow more control for the player that a game should give. Rating: his game should be rated around pg-13 or a little higher, its nowhere near 18+. It has suggestive dialogue, and while there is some nudity it's all suggestive and covered. You will not see anything. I played this game in my lecture hall because of how tame it was. My suggestion, if you're going to go for it, give it 100% don't bother holding back. My recommendation: T If you're looking for a really light, linear manga with really pretty images and a lot of suggestive content. Then sure, I can see that you may get some enjoyment from this, otherwise, I can't really recommend this for anyone. For those looking for some form of hentai buy the game, support the devs, but it isn't worth it. There was a lot more that could have been done, and I hope the devs really try and push what they can do with their other work.\n",
      " Game Details Published by: Dingaling Productions, LLC Developed by: Dingaling Genre: Adventure, Indie, RPG Release Date: 15 Dec, 2014 Completionist Gameplay: 50+ Hours DISCLAIMER: I’ll be honest here. This game didn’t really do anything for me at all and I barely put any time at all into it (probably the reason why I didn’t enjoy it as much as others seem to have), but I can certainly see why so many people loved it. I tried my best to review this as objectively as possible and have used that to decide that this game deserves a “recommended” review. LISA is set in a post-apocalyptic setting about a man called Brad who stumbles upon the last girl on earth. After keeping her safe from the rest of the men on the planet for many years while raising her as his own daughter, the secret is out and leagues of pervy men arrive to kidnap her. While the story is interesting enough, it never really caught my attention. It’s sarcastic humour and meta jokes combined with the depressing, hopeless and sometimes boring background story or characters left a bad taste in my mouth, though I can certainly see how it could be equally as amazing for another person. This game doesn’t really bring anything new to the table, but it doesn’t do too many things wrong either. It’s an average, 2D-plane, occasional platformer with turn-based combat. While I like the added depth of special combo’s Brad and the other members of his party can use to inflict extra damage on their enemies if the player can remember the right combinations, as the game progresses you don’t get to do anything new. One thing I really dislike about the combat system is that there isn’t an enemy health bar at all. This can cause issues when in a particularly difficult and long fight, leaving you to feel like it might never very vanilla and seems to be modelled after the classic model RPG, so if you’re into that, this game is for you! The platforming is mostly there to flesh out the scenery or reveal a little comedic scene. If you’re not careful though, you’ll continue on a cliff to the side of the screen, only to discover that it ended without any warning and you’ve just lost 500 HP. One thing I really liked about this game are the choices it makes you take as you play. These choices will alter how you play the game, and definitely personalize the whole experience. For example, you could bribe an enemy instead of fighting him, sacrifice party members instead of your own arm, or even partake in optional mini-games (like russian roulette) that could either make or break your gaming experience. These choices really help the player realize exactly how hopeless and desolate this world is. The art style and music choices of this game were very clever. The scenes and backgrounds are very beautiful, colourful and vibrant, and the music is invigorating and upbeat yet somehow do not clash with the macabre feeling of the story Overall, I can see why this game is as loved by many as it is. There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the game, the story is interesting, the game is playable, the art style is both beautiful and yet depressing and it certainly has enough gameplay hours for the price of it. If you’re a fan of RPG’s and hopeless efforts, I would recommend this for you as long as you’re sure that it’s something that you’ll love.

      "HuniePop is an anime style match-3 dating sim that does not take itself to serious. In the game you can date and later sex up to twelve girls, 8 are instantly available 2 are unlocked later and 2 are secret unlocks. They are all well written and have some good voice acting, so you never really need to read what they are saying, if you dont want. The dating works through a match-3 game, similar to others in the genres, but with some interesting unique mechanics in there. After your 4th date you can get a girl to stay over, it is not animated though. The difficulty scales well throughout the game, but you can also set the difficulty to easy or hard in the options if you want. The art style is very good for a low buddget anime game and the girls look all really good, which keeps you in. The game is really cliche and sexist at times, which may be a downside for some people, but it is also self aware of it and makes fun of it. The game can be funny if you dont have a problem with the racism and like the randomness of some conversations and what-the-f moments. As one can probably see, I really liked the game. The only negative I can really say is that if you just want it for the erotic/hentai aspect and cant dig the dating sim or the match-3 stuff it will probably be overprised for you, also since it is not very lenghthy and there is nothing to do besides talking to the girls, looking for presents for them and dating them. But I would not say it is not diversified. The game mixes the management parts and the puzzle parts well enough to keep things varied. I really enjoyed the game and it is so far one of my favourite games this year.\n",
      "Another gift, another visual novel centered around giving you an erection. I had literally no idea what this game was about. No, I did not skip 90% of the dialouge and only stared at the CG images like most of the people that bought this game, I read through it and I still don't know what's going on. Sakura Spirit at least had something you could follow, you were warped to some sort of past dimension with fox spirit girls with large breasts, in Go! Go! Nippon! you were Weeaboo McBasement going to visit two internet friends with large breasts (well one of them at least) in Japan. In Sakura Angels you play as Socially Awkward Protagonist™, who is on his way to school but suddenly you get attacked by Satan! But luckily two big breasted girls in skimpy outfits come save you. Or you run away (yes, this game has multiple choices!) but run into the two anyway. These two turn out to be some sort of guardian angels (hence the same I guess) that protect the world from evil, which turns to be lurking at Socially Awkward Protagonist's™. Now here's the thing with the two girls: at day they're generic waifu material schoolgirls and at night they become some sort of rescue rangers or Sailor Moons and fight Satan and/or tentacle monsters or that mean white-haired girl from school. If there is one thing I can appreciate in terms of characters, it's the fact that this time our protagonist isn't so full of respect that he doesn't even dare to admire his guardian angels looks like our good old friend Default McProtagonist from Sakura Spirit. In some occasions he even dares to stare at pink-haired girl's butt, which is already a great step-up from Sakura Spirit. ANYWAY, remember those multiple choices I mentioned before? Turns out that the choices that are related to the two girls actually affect the kinda. You can either chose to always root for blonde boobs or pink-haired boobs OR if you need two waifu in your laifu, you can pick both by just altering between the two, yes this is some heavy stuff. The other choices don't affect the story at all, you just read some different dialouges. At first it may seem to bring a bit more variety, but as it turns out it's really nothing life-changing. This game suffers from the same problem as the other two games, the storyline is not interesting enough so they just market the game with the barely dressed, big-chested ladies, which works for most people, and I could forgive the whole '90% boobs, 10% story' thing, if they really tried with the art. The thing with these visual novel games is that the art for every character is just one image that changes it's face every now and then with the occasional CG image that's only there for you screencap, might as welll just sell those images for 5 bucks because that's the only reason people buy this. However, if there's one thing I can mark off as good is the fact that they at least tried with the multiple choice thing, but out of this, Sakura Spirit and GGN, GGN still takes the cake with actually giving you a different line of plot depending on what your choices are. This game tries, but that is still underwhelmed by the sexualization of every female in it. I can't even think of good jokes at this point/10.\n",

      "Eldevin: The Grinder's Game, as a f2p game, I do really enjoy Eldevin. By far it has the best f2p model out of any game I've ever seen. Instead of penalizing you for not being a supporter, you have access to 100% of the game without any restrictions, being a supporter just gives you buffs, and overall makes the game more easily playable later down the road with things such as double relic gain to increase the speed in which you get armor sets and so on. So let's start with the pros of the game, of course everyone has different opinions so some things I like a lot, others might think is no big deal. First, as of now there is no Auction House, which I deeply enjoy because it makes trading a much more personal, and organic feeling, to actually have to look for someone selling/buying something makes you really feel like your trading unlike dumping stacks of items into an AH and waiting for someone to buy it and automatically receive gold. I enjoy the 'class' system, as in there really are no classes, there are multiple talent trees including your three classic archtypes; ranger, warrior, and mage, followed by assassin, prophet, and templar. You are free to spend your points wherever you choose, thus making it really feel like you're building your own unique class. Attribute points are much the same, you get 6 attribute points every time you level in which you are free to spend between 6 attributes; vitality, energy, focus, ranged, sorcery, and melee. Allowing you to make countless combinations with this system. The thing I like the most about the game is the limited number of skills you can use. Often times in most MMOs, such as World of Warcraft I find that I have about 10,000 abilities, and about 9,950 do the same exact thing, or slightly off of another ability. With so many abilities I find myself constantly watching over my action bars and never focusing on the actual game, then I question myself 'Why am I playing a game where all I do is watch little squares fill up again and glow so then I can click and watch them again?' It feels like I'm ochestrating a Beethoven piano masterpiece. However, in Eldevin it's much, much different I can go through a dungeon using only 3-4 abilities and focus more on the game and the environment rather than just my action bar managing cooldowns, that being said however, the combat is very basic, standstill and attack combat. Now, onto the cons, before I start however, I know that Eldevin is NOT a Triple A, mainstream production and that it is an indie f2p MMO, therefor there is some room for slack. Right off the bat I noticed how rough the human animations are, your arms stand straight to your sides and when you run it isn't much better. I specifically say human animations, because not all the animations are bad, which blows my mind, because as you progress through the game you'll encounter various style of spiders, and I'd say the spider animations are about 99% legit, their legs move realistically, almost to the point where it's scary. With that being said, I don't understand why your own character is so rough when there's spiders out there that are 10x better. Eldevin is able to be controlled using a classic WASD system, however it is also point-to-click, much like Runescape. This offers a different, unique style of movement not offered by other MMOs, it can also be a nuisance as well, often times the path finding is clunky and your cameras and character will flip out and run in different directions, or as a mage or ranger you'll go to begin to attack a target from a range, and instead of getting into line of sight and attacking, you'll run straight up into the mobs face and then start attacking, little things like this bother me, and in my opinion it'd be better off without point-to-click movement in total. I have to admit, I did have quite a bit of fun leveling in this game, the max level is 45, and it took me roughly 5-6 days to reach it, playing pretty regularly, the quests are your typical generic MMO quests, but occasionally you'll get a long story line that removes you from that 'Collect 10 Boar Flanks' 'Grab 12 Bags of Flour' ditch that drags on. The Story lines are decent enough and long enough to provide you with a break from all the grinding as you unsolve mysteries like who assassinated a mage without the Arcane Sanctum, or freeing a brigade of Eldevin soldiers from the Void. Besides the story lines, the questing is nothing substantial and you'll be glad to reach level 45. The dungeons are much the same as the quests, just grinds. There is Story Mode dungeons which are soloable, (farmable) and Dungeon Mode dungeons which are undoable for the most part due to the low population of the game, average queues are between 1hr-2hrs on most days for most dungeons, so for the most part you'll be soloing Story Mode dungeons. The bosses in the dungeon are nothing short of spectacular, 90% of them are basic Tank n' Spank fights with AoEs to avoid, nothing ground breaking, and nothing challenging. The biggest problem with the game, and you sort of can't blame the game, but then again if the game was more popular it wouldn't have the problem, is it's low population, you'll see the same people online all day, every day. You'll group with the same people, trade with the same people, and talk with the same people. Which isn't too much of a problem, because you'll just get to know them and befriend them, or dislike them and have bitter rivalries, but it would just be nicer to have a larger population, but I guess every game wants that right? The low population calls for many problems though such as; the limited amount of max level crafters/gatherers, you'll have to wait for them to come online, they're celebrities. The endless dungeon queues, and facing the same people over, and over in PvP, which leads to a major problem. Only the same people PvP in Eldevin, so if you are new to level 45 and undergeared I hightly recommend you DON'T attempt PvP or you'll just be slaughtered in seconds by the top geared members of Eldevin. PvP revolves entirely around gear seeing that the combat is so basic, it's much like the Revolutionary War, lining up across from each other and shooting face to face until the other drops, whoever has the better stats is going to win the spam fireball at each others face game, so PvP loses its appeal to me in this game just for the sheer lack of fun, it's either spam fireball someone less geared than I am, or get spam fireballed by someone more geared than I am. Being 45 in Eldevin in total lacks much fun, it's like growing up, when you are a kid you get to have all the fun, then you become an adult and the serious business starts, likewise is that to the levels in Eldevin, as soon as you hit 45, if you are to compete with other 45's you will need to grind the same dungeon for hours, for weeks, to get the gear, never making you feel accomplished because all you did was spam fireball on some spiders for a week to get your gear. All in all it's a decent game, but it needs a lot of work, and a lot of content. It quickly loses its luster as you level. Eldevin isn't all that bad though, it really gives you a generic MMO feel, so its very good for first time MMO players to get the hang of them. It's extremely easy to learn and play, without spending hours watching tutorials or reading up on it. The biggest thing is that it's f2p, and you can't go wrong with that, the only thing you have to spend to play is your time. Therefor I can't 'Not Recommend' it, because you can lose anything. It's a good enough game to spend a couple weeks playing, and to revisit occasionally. \n",
      "AdVenture Capitalist is a grindy addictive little game. It's very simple, but time consuming. If you are wondering why so many people have a lot of 'playtime'in this game its because you collect money while you have it running. It actually gives you money even when you are offline, but its nice to have it running so you can upgrade as soon as possible. This game is actually pretty flat. It doesnt give you much cool stuff, its always just a new grind to yet another unlock. Everytime you level up something it always doubles the amount of cash gain. It's still very addictive for some strange reason. I guess its because people in general just love unlocks and progression in a game, even if it doesnt do much. This is a free to play game, but doesnt force you to buy anything really. You can buy some things for real money if you wish, but I dont see a reason for doing so, unless you want some cosmetic things. Just let the game play itself and you will have lots of money to spend on new upgrades. This looks like it could be a mobile game, but it does not have any microtransation problem as these kinds of games on appstore normally have. Options are good and you can play in window mode with a lot of different resolution options. This game should be possible to run on most computers, and steam cloud is available, which I always appreciate since I own more then one gaming computer. Its a good game for being free. I dont know if its actually fun, but it sure is addicting. Try it out if you have some time to waste and you wanna feel like you're accomplishing something.\n",
      "This this game. It's adorable, it's fun, it's interesting. Recettear is indeed an Item Shop's tale; you take on the mantle of your father's incredible debt as Recette, an earnest and sincere young girl who's eager to preserve the house in the name of her father and facillitate the alleviation of said debt by turning it into a nifty little item shop at the behest of an authentic loan shark Tear, the fairy representing the people Recette's adventurous father owes all her money to. To do so, she needs to sell items and make weekly payments while balancing other economic decisions, such as buying stock, and time itself is also a commodity. There're truly different faucets of gameplay to this wonderful gem: dungeon crawling and making dough (not literally, she isn't Alicia and thus doesn't work in a bakery. There is another guide for that kinda Time is important as it determines what you can do. You only have X amount of time to do things each day, and certain activities, like going to the pub (no the girl won't get drunk, don't even think about it) for some reason or another, or going dungeon crawling, or operating the shop, or going to the park; interactions with other characters will often happen in places that don't serve an obvious purpose. Operating the shop involves managing the general ambience, as well as determining item placement (window shoppers should be taken advantage of folks), and involves attracting customers to investigate your stock and then haggling with them to get a better price. People will come in and ask for things you have set out, as well as things you have in storage. They'll also try to sell things to you, in which case you haggle for a lower price. Don't be like me and confuse the two, resulting in a loss of product or blowing all your money on a soggy loaf of bread. Successfully haggling and other things improves your rank and what not, increasing your access to X benefit and Y item, etc. Haggling in and of itself is mostly intuitive; you'll quickly realize that different people, like in real life, are malleable to different degrees when negotiating price, and they'll let you know if the price you selected bothers them (or walk out flustered. And beware of the little girl, she's stingy). The items themselves come in a wide variety, from food to clothing to weapons and the expensive dish thingy I found that people ignore in favor of chocolate. Why chocolate? . It's a blast to run through a cave picking up all these weird things and assembling your flying circus of a collection at the store to reintroduce them to society via CAPITALISM HO! To get items, you can buy stock, but it's best to get it through dunegon crawling; over the course of the game, Recette will encounter various characters, many of whom will become available as dungeon buddies who will slaughter hordes of strange bouncing goopballs to get you chocolate (and a plethora of other items; there's some RNG thrown into the whole thing). You crawl the dungeon, hacking and slashing and using special abilities and picking up items and eventually finding doors to let you exit the dungeon, for if you succumb to the horrors within your ability to leave with all the nice loot you got is severely limited. Boss fights are interesting and fun and the integration of action adventure hack and slash combat with the rigors of running the weirdest store ever provide a unique and delightful game play experience that actually, despite being a mashup of entrepreneurship and super spelunking, works quite well and delivers something I haven't really been able to compare to anything else. TL;DR Adventure RPG with hack and slash mechanics, as well as business simulation. Loli kawaii shopkeeper and friends slay baddies to get goodies and sell them for $ to save the world her livelihood. Cute, fun, unique, I totally recommend this, it's a great experience for me, and hopefully it will be for you too ^_^\n",
      "this is perhaps one of the best market games on steam, though ideally there are not very many comparable games. Here is the things i think about it. 1. has a very unique overall feeling to it, all about making money and makes a impressive display of humour. 2. very well designed. The creator put a lot of work into making this game look appealing. 3. impressive game mechanics, although the system is somewhat limited the spacing between money making is very well made and is effective at showing you how the whole system works. 4. incredibly fun to play, in other words the game ingages you to play it and almost always countinues to be very fun to play. 1. has a pay to win market. Even though it is completly non-needed to spend any money, it is a very limited market that only has a few shop items. I honestly think that the shop needs to be overhauled and expanded. Because the items have an only 'eh' appeal. 2. You can eventually over-play the game, in other words this game limits how much you can do with money. When you get to the later stages and reached the trillion cash levels you can literally overspend all your money, then you will have to wait a few days to get more money. I honestly wish that i could play this game more fully and not have to play it in 60 minute periods then have to wait a few days for the cash to build up. 3. Incourages you to spend money. The way to avoid over spending yourself is to buy stuff like an to the-future item that gives you an certain amount of days worth of profit. This is greedy and i honestly think that the creators shouldnt have used such tactics to make more money. Overall I have to say that this game is worth a try and i think that you will enjoy this experiance however limited the games market is and how many flaws are in-game. I have to say that this is a acceptable 7/10 and i recommend it\n",

      "Crazily addicting like crack, though I've never done crack but anywho (for real though hard to put I can't put my finger on what keeps pulling you back into this game, but it's like just one more match, just one crap it's hours later didn't mean to be on this more LOl to get to a more serious review though: Yes this game is fun and there's a lot more to it than first meets the eye. However, it IS A multiplayer team based (4 divers vs 2 sharks) PVP game to it's core so expect nothing else (meaning it's fast and furious team vs team gameplay). Sharks vs Divers on an epic scale, or Divers vs Sharks how ever you perfer (mostly shark player here ;P ). The one main and pretty much only game mode atm is Blood and Gold, but really it's all you need. As divers collect your treasure and take it to so he can bank it for you to use on your next respawn, that way you can upgrade your weapons and deployables, as you escort him to the end where he'll be yanked free from the jaws of those nasty sharks wanting to destroy him and you the divers. As sharks it's your job to rid your waters of those pesky gold grabbin divers and their robotic friend . As you munch down more divers you'll gain evolution points to use on your next respawn so you can be tankier, faster, stealthier, and more destructive as you grow in power. Each shark has it's own specialized skills, for example the hammerhead perfers smashing divers into everything for the fast kill, where a thresher loves to smack the crap outta the divers with his tail lash and nasty threshing, and the tiger shark loves to go all stealth for the sneak attack. No worries though as I said divers get a huge range of different gear to use, from a sonar buay to detect nearby sharks, to mines, to weapons upgrades and mods so you can use dual pistols or go full boar machine gun and even add bleeding or toxic to each round sent down lane at those nasty pesky sharks. This game is unique in many ways, and ever so addicting, however it has a high skill ceiling so don't expect to just pick it up and be the best from the get go (though some do have natural talent); a lot of players have put in countless hours to be as good as they are. The game is totally worth it, and has a good top lvl community. Yes every bunch has it's bad apples, but most of the top players will treat you with respect and you'll find are very friendly if you do and act the same to them. Game devs could use a little people skills, but they've put people in place to help with that. Game gets updated often (and often includes free stuff like new maps, new diver gear, new sharks, new skin drops and has many sales that keep the community going, one of which will probably be a big one coming up that will include community skins. If you've looked at this game and have been on the fence, just jump over it; you'll be surprised just how much there is to this game, but remember it's a multipayer team vs team kinda game so expect nothing else. GG- Good Game totally worth it and I'll see you under the Sea for some more GGs'.\n",
      "Depth is an wonderful PC game bringing a whole new type of combat to the forefront making it a game that is both suspenseful and action packed. Pro’s: Easy to learn, good skill progression, really easy to run, well balanced, great longevity, and REALLY STINKIN’ FUN!!!! Con’s: 3 game modes, not enough maps, community is bad, only recommend buying if you have friends to play with, way too expensive to buy at standard price. Gameplay: Depth is a game that is notably easy to learn but hard to master. Playing as a shark sounds like it would be really difficult but it's actually really easy. Sharks handle just the same as the diver, so jumping from one to the other is extremely intuitive. Each of the 6 sharks has a distinct advantage over the previous one with different levels of durability, speed, and killing power. Playing as a diver is the easier of the two roles at the start, since the divers get a heartbeat variating from slow, medium to fast depending on how close the shark is. Gunplay is also a pleasant surprise considering the setting is in water. Guns and water don’t usually mix, but they sure do in this case. Bullets from guns also have water resistance so they move slower and don’t travel very far but have enough power so they don't feel weak, which makes the game actually playable for the sharks. Since all of the weapons are well balanced and require skill to use, the more powerful weapons are not always a go to because they are expensive and take time to collect the necessary cash in order to buy, but these expensive weapons are usually a one shot kill. But considering that, it doesn't become unfair for the shark fighting against the divers with the more powerful weapons as they are a single shot and then you have to reload. Game Modes: Only three? Yeah. Only three game modes, that's a pretty absurdly low number of game modes to choose from. But on the bright side, the three modes are really well done and present different difficulties to each type of player by presenting teamwork, survival, progress, competition, and FUN! First game type is Blood and Gold. Each side has 30 life tickets. Diver’s are to protect the automated submersible robot that collects treasure from designated points along a linear track, stopping at each of the points for about 1-2 minutes while the divers are to protect themselves and said robot, all while scavenging for miscellaneous treasure to collect more cash to buy more weapons and upgrades for weapons. Sharks meanwhile are to kill divers. Each kill results in 10 upgrade points to spend on evolutions like bleed damage, more protection and better stamina. The second gamemode is Megalodon. All players spawn in as divers and the first one to kill the roaming Megalodon becomes it. Whoever has the most kills at the end as the Megalodon wins. Last gamemode is Hide and Seek. Pretty simple. Divers hide, sharks seek. The Heartbeat is a huge tool for the divers in this mode as it adds a huge level of immersion and intensity to this simple gamemode, all the sharks have to go on is localizing the sound of the divers respirator and the distinct looking bubbles coming from the respirator. Community/Online Connectivity: Oh dear. This is where this game has one of its shortcomings and why I would only recommend purchasing this game if you have a minimum of 3 friends to play with. Depth’s community is pretty trash. If you are a “noob” at this game and just bought it, don’t bother jumping into a public server as the more seasoned players will absolutely destroy you. People also leave matches consistently making it hard to really enjoy playing on public lobbies. Depth has very good connectivity with very good netcode so there isn’t any rubber-banding or lag at all, and its servers are really stable other than a few times where my friends would jump into a private hide and seek server and it would change it to a blood and gold game mode. But other than a few weird moments like that, it was solid. Looks: This game looks fantastic. Blur effects with being in the water limiting visual distance are on point adding to the suspense and realism. Lighting in this game is a huge deal, as a diver you get to experience the bigger contrast in how light or dark the scenery is by the level of light fading as you dive deeper, also adding to the immersion. I would say the only real complaint I have with this game’s aesthetics is the ambient wildlife such as the fish, as they look more akin to plastic replicas rather than real life fish. Also adding to that the pathing for the wildlife is incredibly basic, but gets the job done for a “fuller world”. Performance, Stability, and Options: Depth runs incredibly well, maintaining 60 frames per second even on lower end systems, unless you are running it on a potato laptop with integrated graphics. All thanks to how scalable this game is by the many options it has to offer. Price/Content: I’m sorry but Depth is not worth $25. Considering when there are only three game modes with not enough maps for 2 out of the 3 is practically criminal. Especially when there is 14 DLC packs for this game. each of these packs is $5-6, 10 of which are skin packs and 1 of the 2 “Character Packs” is a diver, which is just a skin because the divers don’t have stats differentiating themselves from one another. Hide and Seek only has 4 maps and Megalodon has 5, while Blood and Gold has 12 maps. Seems awfully unbalanced for only having three gamemode. Depth is just not worth $25 as the standard price. I would say its value for what you get is $10, not more, not less. Luckily this game does go on sale fairly frequently for around $10 which makes up for most of what I have just covered in this section. This was really the big problem for me when reviewing this game. Other Notes: Digital Confectioners needs to add custom server support, and REALLY need to add map creation tools for this game. Put these two things out and you are going to have a huge spike in overall player count. I can also think of two really cool game modes for Digital Confectioners to add. Shark Vs Shark, and Diver Vs Diver I suggest the titles to be “Blood Bath”, and “Water Wars” respectivel, because alliterations, and they would be so rad. I mean 3v3 sharks! That would be an insane game mode if implemented correctly. Final Conclusion: Depth is a wonderful game with a great implementation of underwater combat that is beautiful to look at, has intensity and suspense, and is incredible to play at lan parties. I love this game despite its bad community, lack of content, and its huge price tag. But when you sit down and play a few rounds with your friends, those problems fade away as you are having so much fun teasing your friends about how they can't find you in hide and seek, or how you are fighting in blood and gold down to the last life ticket, that’s when this game makes up for its shortcomings.\n",
      "I love this game. Thats what I need to say first. Few game tips at the very end. Pros: Nice team balance (as in 4 divers vs. 2 sharks) It can run on low spec computers Nice level/skill system Some cool skins (which randomly drops at times) Can be beautiful with high spec computers. Nice thrill with the heart beats on the divers side. Divers only gets to see the sharks through walls only when the sharks bites/detected by flare/sonar. Divers being highlighted through walls for the shark side. Majority of the maps are good. There is a learning curve you have to go through. I guess the super smart AIs? You can jump out from the ocean to get the JAWS feels Cons: Matchmaking is horrible In depth review: Okay so this game is really worth buying but I feel like $20 is expensive a bit, so I recommend you to buy this game when its on sale. It is worth a buy! It is totally worth a buy, because you will enjoy the thrill the game gives you. Anyways, I'm gonna go through few of the pros and cons I've listed. First, good team balance. I say it's balanced because the sharks can kill divers really quick (depends on how fast the player thrashes, but you can still kill the divers easily unless you do not thrash at all). This does not mean the sharks are super OP hands down. The diver who has been caught is really helpless, so it depends on the other three divers. If two sharks caught two divers, then there are the other two that can help them out. Then wouldn't that mean the sharks busy eating would also be helpless? Well this matters on how you play as a shark. Yes, you are hopeless when you're in middle of divers with guns doing nothing but eating. No, you're not completely helpless if you hit and run. After biting, sharks need to run or else they can die. Now, the divers can choose to watch his mate helplessly die or to chase after the shark to help the diver out or at least avenge for the gonner. This game can be played without team work, but it will be definitely fun to have your friends to get some team work. In case if you are wondering with the highlighting and heart beat system, read this next two paragraph. If not, don't read it. I want to save your time. As a diver you have this heart beat system. As you can already guess, when the sharks comes closer your heart beat increases to warn you. But you do not know the sharks exact location. They can be right by the corner, they be on the opposite side of the wall, they can be right above you. You do actually get to know their exact location if they bite one of the divers, be detected by flares, or by being detected by sonar buoys. As a shark, if you come closer to the divers you can see them highlighted through walls or even without walls. This helps the shark side so much because if there wasn't any system like this, I tell you, the divers immediately becomes a stealth squad and you would ask yourself a question which is suppose to be the hunter and prey. Okay next. The team balance is excellent, but matchmaking is HORRIBLE. I had to make that in caps for these reasons. One, maybe because there aren't enough people playing this game, but man it can take more than 3 - 5 minutes to find a match. It could be possible that this is due to the game being underrated, poor servers, or whatever the reasons. Although, sometimes you can find a match ultra super hyper excellently fast. Sometimes, even you chose to be a shark or diver you get on the oppsite team of what you wished. This is probably because the game couldnt find enough players on one side. Secondly and lastly, you do not get to play with the player on your skill level. So yes you do meet with level 80's and 100's sometimes even though you're like level 1, 2, 20, doesn't matter. However think like this, the level does not actually tell how good they are. Skilled players are skilled and non-skilled are non-skilled, level does not matter. Some level 100s can be weaker than a 20, 30, whatever level. Seriously though, in this game level does not really matter it all depends on your skills. You can level up quickly in the beginning so you can unlock skills and items real quick. After you go through the learning curves its all about your skills. But yeah higher levels are more experienced so they are usually stronger. But think about it. This was probably a sacrifice the devs had to make due to the lack of population. If you feel like buying this game here are few tips for beginners: STICK TO DIVERS (its a robot where divers put all their treasures in) Sharks: Don't think about breaking because its just impossible unless your opponent is all clueless about the game. Don't leave the game just because your opponent is ultra fantasticoly super hyper nova strong. Don't leave because the seals dodge you in the perfect timing. Don't leave because you're gonna get a bot take over your place. Don't underestimate the bots because they are really smart. They've got aim hacks, wall hacks, and insta (not really) kill hacks. Here are some reasons why I nominated this game for awards: this game, first of all, does not have much attention even though its really great. Second, the price is not bad for what it provides. Now, you even have cool skins to play around with. Third, for a pvp game this is great. No toxic community, no salt, intense, fun to play solo and with friends, not super competetive, and fairly balanced pvp.\n",

      "This is the best horror game I've ever played! If you like scary games then Five Nights at Freddy's is a great game for you\n",
      "Given the rise of popularity of this smash indie-horror title, I felt I should do a review. Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie horror game where you play as Micheal Schmidt, a security guard who as him, basically try to survive against four animatronic animals trying to kill you. The catch? You don't move and you have a limited power supply, meaning you have to be conservative with your power or else Freddy the Fazbear, the titular character of the game, will come and murder you. Five Nights at Freddy's pits you in a broken down (I call it that because of how decrepid a lot of things look in the game) pizzareia that hosts a number of animatronic anthromorphic animals (like you would see in Chuck E. Cheese), most infamously Foxy the Pirate himself. Each animatronic has their own meaning that they do NOT act similar and will try to use their own methods of killing you. You, the player are left to utilize a set cameras set around the place, a set of doors that go down in an emergency (when Bonnie or Chica are right outside your door) and door lights for when you have NO idea where they are on the cams. As the nights progress, the animatronics will become more and more aggressive, with more frequent attacks, and sometimes they will linger outside your doors for longer periods of time. Though it's on Night 4 when Freddy himself becomes a bit of an issue himself, as he can litterally sneak in while you check the cams and gives absolutely NO warning when he's in the room, making his jumpscare all the more startling. Though for newcomers for the game, there is a sort of guide in-game to help, through a series of phone calls left over by the previous security guard. These phone calls give you helpful hints as to being able to survive the nights (such as checking on Pirate Cove periodically, making use of door lights and playing dead if the power goes out). While Five Nights at Freddy's isn't exactly scary, it's more nerving wracking and paranoia-building, making you panic when Bonnie, Chica or even Freddy can't be found on the cameras, and that actually makes the game arguably even more terrifying. Overall, Five Nights at Freddy's is a good horror game that brought new ideas to the table and made them work, though the game is a bit short. Five Nights at Freddy's gets 7/10\n",
      "i like this game but i also like five nights at freddy's 1 2 3 game \n",
      "Five Nights at Freddy's is an indie horror game made by Scott Cawthon. You have to survive 5 nights at a Chuck E. Cheese-esque place called 'Freddy Fazbear's Pizza'. What do you have to survive? Animatronics, yes, animatronics. The four main animatronics are Freddy, Bonnie, Chica and Foxy who all have different attack patterns; different ways to get to YOU. Here are some things that Five Nights at Freddy's does well: Making the player feel challenged: Five Nights at Freddy's starts out very easy but then ramps up the difficulty, especially in the later nights. Making the player feel helpless: Now, it goes without saying that if you were stuck in a place with 4 killer robot furries, you'd feel pretty helpless. And sense you're in a tiny office just waiting for you to get stuffed into a suit, it amplifies it. Fear: Five Nights at Freddy's will obviously be scary, right? Yes, it is scary. If you fail to stay alive through a night, you will be killed by one of the robots in 'A cheap jumpscare? Really?' you might ask. Yeah, the deaths are jumpscares, but it isn't the jumpscare that scares you, it's not knowing when it will happen. If the death is predictable, then it isn't as scary.

      "The basic game design is fun, more's the pity because it's sunk by several flaws and mind boggling design decisions. So the AI is terrible, which would be fine, because it's meant to be a tabletop game. The kind you pull out and play with your friends on a Friday night, but unless you have a ton of friends who own the game you will be playing with you can't talk the designers think that if they implement in game chat it would need to be moderated. So great, playing a table top with tons of strangers that I can't even talk to, besides saying one of about 12 preset phrases. Theoretically, you can get around this by adding people as your steam freinds, but if you want to carry on a converstation you will have to alt-tab out of the game constantly to use steam chat. Imagine having to put your tabletop game back into it's box every time you want to say something other than one of the 12 things the game developers thought of for you. To make a titanically poor decision even worse, the responses are 'personalized' to the characters, so something like 'well played' or *laughs* can come off kind of snarky depending on who you're using. Think one of the other players in the game is nice, or skilled or fun to play with despite the fact that you can barely communicate with them? Well, hope you memorized their name and they know who you are, because there's no in game friend requesting. So basically you have the choice between playing with the mind-numblingly bad AI or waiting 5 minuites for your turn to come around while playing with a much more intellegent human, who serves as a proxy for a better AI because you can't really interact with them. If that's not enough to put you in a straight jacket, the game ends with a summary of your accomplishments using cute little badges for things you accomplished in game. 'What things?' You might ask. Nobody knows; they aren't described anywhere inside the game or any of it's accompanying material, but since they are just for bragging rights, and there's no bragging (due to the lack of a chat function and the fact that when you finish you get dumped into the lobby with a new batch of strangers) I guess it kind of makes a perverse sort of sense, it just makes me completely indifferent to earning these things, since I have no idea what they are. To be fair you can kind of guess at some of them, but others are completely opaque, still with no background it's never like, 'Wow so and so captured 8 cities!' it's more like, 'We all captured cities but so and so edged us out maybe, I can't really tell here, but it kind of sounds like it. He might as well be an ultra slow AI and I'll never see him again anyway, so I guess it doesn't The final critique I have of the game is that the king will mostly die on his own before you can fight him. This makes the ending extremely anticlimatic. Even if it ends in a battle, it will be more like an epic hero bulling a 1-3 hp enemy. I wish you could turn off the constant life drain, at least in the house rules, but alas another opportunity missed. Sadly, Armello is a solid game with good mechanics and a clever use of the digital board game format. If I was sitting in the development studio working out the bugs, or playing in a focus group with three other people I would be having a blast, but sitting in my room throwing canned responses into the ether or alt tabbing out and slowing the game down for everyone so I can carry on a conversation completley kills the fun. It feels kind of like playing Settlers of Catan with a house rule that anyone who speaks has to discard all their sheep.\n",

      "AI War: Fleet Command (AIW), is an Asymmetrical 4X Tower Defense RTS. Which I know probably sounds very jumbled up so let me break that down a little more. Asymmetrical: While you are playing AI Wars, the computer is playing something more akin to Risk. 4X: Pretty self explainatory it follows the 'eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate' style of gameplay. Tower Defense: This is the one that threw me off it at first because I generally don't enjoy TD games, however, in AIW it is more a the defensive side of the game, in that you have a whole arsenal of turrets at your disposal to defend your planets with, while your RTS fleet is off doing offense. They are more akin to towers, and turrets from a traditional RTS like Starcraft or Warcraft. RTS: It is a real time strategy, with a grand campaign feel for it. You have your more 'tactical' fighting at the planet level where you might be maneuvering your fleet to best deal with the AI, but on the Galaxy map that planet is only one of 80 in a normal size game (You can go as little as 10 planets, or as high as 120 I believe) Story: The war for humanity is over, we the AI has all but wiped humans off the face of the galaxy leaving only pockets left in the abyss before turning their attention to more pressing concerns. You play as one of those pockets, and using the AI's absent mindedness to begin rebuilding the human race, and take revenge. Assuming you can be sneaky enough to not draw the full ire of the AI before your plans go off. Personal Take: I've dumped well over 100+ hours into this game over the time I've had it, which is a huge amount for me, however, a drop in the bucket to many of it's fans. This is a game where you start with 1 planet that you call home, everything else is owned by the AI (technically it is two AI, but they are a team). As such you have to be very strategic about how you move forward. If you just kill everything around you, you end up drawing attention to yourself in the form of AI Progress, which in turn causes the AI to send bigger, and stronger attacks against you. If you're playing anywhere near your skill level in the game, that can mean disaster for you. It's very much a game of learning how to push to what you need without necessarily steamrolling everything. The AI in the game is phenomenal, and hands down the best computer AI I've ever seen in any sort of RTS/Strategy game. It does have it's downsides though as the biggest being that there is a pretty steep learning curve for the game. The tutorials do an excellent job teaching you the different aspects and controls of the game, but it is a lot to take in, even with just the base game and no extra fluff turned on. (It's grown a fair bit in the 7 years it has been out). It's other drawback is that it is a hard game, a very hard game. This is mostly by design, as remember we've already lost the war, when you start the game, the AI already has 10k+ ships floating around in the galaxy and getting more as you play. There is a joke among the hardcore players (the 5-6k+ hours played folks) that winning on 10/10 (the hardest difficulty) is a bug, which it normally is. The developers for this game have spent the last 7 years essentially playing a PVP game against their player base of seeing how they exploit various AI missteps at 10/10 and then fixing those with the help of the players. There is a demo on Steam if you want to get your feet wet first. (I love games that provide Demos) If you do enjoy it, or have enjoyed it in the past they announced a few days back that they are making a new one, and are currently running a kickstarter for it if you are interested. They are adding a bunch of new things to it, but the one I'm most looking forward to is the 3D graphics, and re-designed UI.\n",

      "The single player experience is a little short, clocking in at around 6 hours for me. However, everything else about this game is thoroughly enjoyable. I play games on GNU/Linux exclusively and the performance for this game on my OS is great. The art direction is top notch, as in the last two games. Everything about this entry feels like a worthy addition to the Trine franchise. There are some things different in this game, most notably the lack of skill progression. I know former Trine fans might really miss that, but honestly I felt rather ambivalent about it myself. I does it really make much sense anymore anyways? For me, I love Trine for its light-hearted storybook-style fairy tale setting and story. It actually kind of bugged me that if you played the first Trine you started off in Trine 2 without some of the skills you gained in the first one, and some don't even exist in Trine 2 that existed in the first Trine. Likewise when people complain that Amadeus can no longer conjure more than 1 box at a time in Trine 3, I have only to remind everyone about the lack of floating platforms in Trine 2, other player abilities, equipment in chests, etc. So, it's not without precedent. I actually think it's good to see Frozenbyte trying to stretch out and experiment. Accordingly, having the freedom to move along the Z axis in 3D is a great addition. At first I was skeptical and thought it might be too confusing or change up the core gameplay mechanic. But, how it's implemented is done really well. It's different enough to be interesting, but subtle enough to keep things familiar and intuitive. Really, the biggest thing for me (as I mentioned earlier) is the story, and Trine 3 presents something very intriguing that recontextualizes the two prior entries in the franchise. I don't want to give any spoilers away, but suffice it to say the game goes back to its roots and sets out to answer a question I hadn't really thought to ask before: what is the Trine in the first place? What is *its* origin? It's not just this new revelation either. The game also goes back to its roots in bringing back skeletons and other darker elements seen in the first Trine. I actually played Trine 2 first, so going back to the first Trine felt a bit disjointed at first, since the story seemed more epic and a little darker. Trine 3 manages to keep the light-hearted fun tone of Trine 2 while telling a story more on par with the first Trine. Sadly, it looks like the devs were shooting for a story scope that would fit the epic premise of Trine 3. I say sadly, because the game ends rather abruptly on a cliffhanger. Maybe in the future with a DLC or two the story presented can be properly finished. I know some players could look at this as some kind of money grab, since in the past with Trine 2 its DLC expansion was truly an expansion, with the original story relatively standing alone. But, y'know, even there there's precedent. Plenty of films have ended on cliffhangers, and $8 for a 2 hour film at the theatre is still more expensive than $22 for a 6 hour game--especially when said game also includes multiplayer. (Disclaimer: I actually only purchased the game while it was on sale here recently, but mainly that's because I was waiting to get the game once the Linux version exited Beta). All in all, I would definitely recommend getting this game if you like the Trine series. It's definitely different than the prior entries, but if you go into it with an open mind you might just be pleasantly surprised.\n",
      "DO NOT BUY TRINE 3!!! I recommend you buy Trine 1 and Trine 2 instead. The developers ruined Trine 3 by shifting from a 2D to a 3D platformer. The 3D aspect of Trine 3 ruined the Trine franchise. They also remove the upgradable abilities for each hero which is a big mistake! Frozenbyte should've just stick with a 2D platform game like Trine 1 and Trine 2. If they made Trine 3 as a 2D platform game with features included in Trine 1 & 2, it will get positive reviews and sell well. Good thing I bought this during steam sale. *Note to Developers: If you're gonna make another Trine game make sure its a 2D platform game with all the features included in Trine 1 & Trine 2!!! If it ain't broken don't fix it! Then maybe you can add some new features like pickable gear & equipments for the three heroes. It will also help if you can create a better story with a serious tone.\n",
      "Just play Trine 1 and 2\n",
      "I'm not much of a reviewer, but after reading the response to Trine 3 I felt I should also put in my two cents. Because I really liked Trine 3. Despite being very different from the previous games in the series, Trine 3 still has the beauty and the soul I came to know and love. The gameplay has changed (pretty drastically), but that is not necessarily a bad thing. This is what I thought was positive, neutral, and negative; The positive: - The storytelling. Now, it is true that the story in Trine 3 has an open ending (which I agree with other reviewers is a negative point). However, the part of the story that is told is told magnificently. The story of Trine 3 tackles the origin of the Trine and the other artifacts of power. Personally, I was completely engaged by the story, much more so than I was by the stories of Trine and Trine 2. I really hope there will be another game to finish the tale. - Visuals. The Trine games are all beautiful, this one being no exception. Everything is as colorful and fairytaleish as ever. I particularly loved the extra detail poured into the appearance of the three heroes. With each installment they've become more recognizable, which I consider a big plus. The first Trine was about a Thief, a Wizard and a Knight. Trine 3 is about Zoya, Amadeus and Pontius. Also, one level (I believe level 6) takes places within the pages of a book - rarely have I seen any part of a game that beautiful. Wow. - The music. There's really not much to say about this; it's amazing. The soundtrack was made by the same person who made the soundtracks of Trine and Trine 2, and he has yet again failed to disappoint. - The single character levels. In the main storyline levels of Trine 3, you can play as all three characters, just like in the previous games. However, Trine 3 also features plenty of non-story levels in which you only control one character. There are a few level focusing only on combat (most of which you play as Pontius, but also one as Amadeus) and each character has two mini-levels focused around that character alone. Pontius was separated from his companions, and his two levels focus on him getting back to them. Zoya's levels detail her search for the giant emerald she was chasing at the beginning of the game, and Amadeus takes a nap and goes on a quest for the elusive fireball spell in his dreams. I thought these levels were really quirky and fun. The neutral: - The 3D. On one hand, it is a refreshing change from the first two Trine games. The extra dimension really adds to the puzzle aspects of the game, opening a whole new dimension (literally) of possibilities. On the other hand, the camera sometimes acts wonky and missing a platform and dying is very easy. The 3D is great for the puzzles, less great for the platforming. - The character's abilities. Like many other reviewers, I was sad to see the variety of hero-specific tools and powers diminished. Zoya no longer has any special arrows, Pontius has lost his hammer, and Amadeus can now only conjure one box at a time. However, there are some new abilities I really came to like. Zoya's rope (grappling hook) has become much more advanced. She can now tie both ends of the rope to two different objects, which is very helpful for solving puzzles. And, my favorite change, Amadeus is now actually useful in battle. I had tons of fun smashing boxes down on enemies, and he was actually my go-to combat character this time around. - Having to collect Trineangles (which were experience bottles in Trine and Trine 2) to unlock levels. As a collector and achievement hunter, I never even move on to another level until I'm sure I've collected everything in the previous level, but I can imagine other players being frustrated by this. If you do not have enough Trineangles to unlock the next level, you will have to replay a previous level to collect more. The Trineangles, however, are a lot less hard to find than experience bottles, so it should not take too long to collect enough. - There are a few minor bugs. Zoya glitches a bit when she has her bow drawn, sometimes you can phase though part of a wall, that sort of thing. I found nothing game-breaking, however, and the little bugs I found did not keep me from enjoying the game. I have read that there were some issues with multiplayer, but having only played solo, I cannot comment on them. Single player works like a charm, at least. The negative: - The lack of challenge. In the first Trine game, there were a few achievements that took some extra effort, like getting through a level without taking any damage. Trine 2 was achievement galore, and I spent many hours chasing the final hard and frustrating, but satisfying achievements. Trine 3, however, is already a fairly easy game, and there are no achievements which require you to do anything particularly special - just complete the game and collect everything. I finished the game (and collected all achievements) in about hours. Compared to Trine 2 (40 hours) and even the first Trine hours), that is very little time. This is not because the game itself is too much shorter than the first two games, but because there is no extra challenge. I would have loved to see some achievements requiring you to finish the game on a hard difficulty, or even some of the wacky achievements from the first two games that force you to go out of your way to do silly things like making an enemy sail on an improvised raft. - The ending. It's been said by many others, and I can only confirm it. The game ends in the middle of the story, which makes it seem unfinished. From the forum I've understood that the developers planned on this from the beginning, but failed to inform their fans. Now, I did not buy Trine 3 immediately after its release, so I had time to read the reviews before purchasing the game and I knew what to expect from the ending. However, I can imagine that those who did buy the game right off the bat were bitterly disappointed by the lack of proper ending. So, if you want to buy Trine 3, do be noted that the ending is completely open and the fate of the heroes is left ambiguous. - There is no leveling. While I was neutral on the characters' abilities being mixed up, I was disappointed by the fact that all abilities are unlocked for every character from the start. The reward of unlocking extra powers for characters (rather than the much more tedious task of having to collect things to unlock levels) is, I think, what made many players chase collectibles happily. Now the collecting has become a chore, as the awesome reward of new abilities has been replaced by the unlocking of levels - which I believe we are already entitled to, as we bought the game, and therefore doesn't feel like a reward at all. So, in conclusion, Trine 3 is indeed very different from Trine and Trine 2, and fans of the previous games are not by default guaranteed to like this one. However, in my opinion, different is not the same as worse in this case. Trine 3 is still a beautiful, quirky game with a lovely story, great characters and wonderful music. As long as you're aware that Trine 3 is not like its predecessors, the game is very enjoyable. I hope FrozenBite will be able to make another addition to the series to give us a satisfying conclusion to the heroes' journey.\n",

      " Influent is possibly best vocabulary memorising game (btw, i'd rather name it - App) I've ever played. For the language learning, Duolingo is a free app with multi languages for you to choose from, to learn some languages based on your native language. FYI: Just as what I said, Influent is designed for basic vocabulary memorising but not recommended for advanced language learners or those who keep many words in mind already. As a college student in language teaching major, I've been told that one of the best way to learn vocabulary or to have language learners memorize it is have the words integrated with animation or with graphic presentations, which can stimulate the learners' brain and improves efficiency, leaving them with less vocabulary lethe. That's how Influent works here. Hence if you're a starter in a language, Influent can definitely bring you tons of fun in learning it. Go get it and just get started.\n",
      "The idea to learn language while doing something fun is great, It can't be like in this game. There is no actual goal (except for time attack mode). If it had some kind of quests, where you have to learn a word or a sentence to get further it would have been more useful. Like this - it's pointless. You just walk around and click on things. I believe it would be cheaper to get a simple old-school vocabulary. Or like I reemmber, when I was learning English there was a game for native English speaker to learn ther language. I mean for kids. It even had a story, a whole map and a bunch of playable characters. Gameplay was made of moving through map and solving different puzzles and or playing mini-games, where you had to find a correct word suiting the situation, make a sentence. Some games were simply for learning new words or even some grammar rules. Too bad I do not remember the name of the game =( Oh, and yes, I just played a fewminutes to realise, that this is NOT an educational material. So do not be alarmed by the 0hr stamp.\n",
      "Influent is a language learning game in which you wander around a 3D, cartoony rendering of a small flat, identifying everything you see in a foreign language. The spatial aspect of the game is interesting and does help you remember nouns, and the timed trials to find a list of objects is pretty good as a challenge. However, the way adjectives and verbs are handled interesting. They're assigned to related nouns, in a way that spans from obviously good to downright confusing. I think maybe with a lot of practice this system might make a bit more sense but I never got there. The real killer for this as an educational application is that there is not nearly enough content. 300 words is not even remotely near enough - XKCD's famous Up Goer Five uses the top 1000 words, and you need about 3000 words to be able to put vaguely sane sounding sentences together. I can get that this isn't a full language learning application (there's no grammar at all) and that's fine. But considering all this does is teach you vocabulary, despite its other strengths, this game just doesn't teach you enough vocabulary to be useful. So despite the endearing art style, the slick Dustforce-esque soundtrack and the cool concept, this game needs an order of magnitude more content to be anywhere near worth its asking price (£7 last I checked). And remember, that's *just* for vocabulary. To pick an example to contrast, Duolingo does grammar, idiomatic usage, full text translation, pronunciation guidance *and* a much wider range of vocab, on a portable platform, for free. If you're intereseted in educational games, maybe have a look at this for an example of a slick product that partially succeeds, with ideas worth considering. But if you're actually trying to learn a language, this does far too little of just a narrow slice of what you need to be of significant use.\n",
      "As a lover and learner of languages, i'm glad i found this little gem. Influent puts you in the shoes of an inventor whose invention has been ripped-off! Yeah, a language game with somewhat of a plot, i know 0_0. it's pretty unique though and a little bit of a quirky side story. The inventor states on his Fire-starter page that to prove this invention is his he will master 400 words in a foreign language. The game pretty much takes place in this guy's apartment and every item you click on teaches you the word in your language of choice. I was kindly gifted the Japanese version so for example if i click on the popsicles in the freezer the japanese characters or Romaji will show up (Japanese word for popsicles is aisukandi BTW :3 it's literally 'Ice Candy'). You can find a lot of different objects and in turn words all over the house. Collect 10 words to complete a set and then play a game where you search the house to match the words with the object. Do this enough times in the game and you will eventually master this word in-game! And i say in-game because whether or not you remember that word when you stop playing depends on your memory. This game is pretty ingenious when it comes to teaching a foreign langauge. It uses a memory training technique that involves creating a map in your mind and remembering where and what things are. I've never thought of doing that in terms of learning languages because i first learned Japanese watching anime. So i learned a lot of common Japanese phrases from watching anime. Anime also introduced me to a lot of other languages here and there. Kampfer introduced me to German, Croisse in a Forgein Labrinyth introduced me to French and Hetalia introduced me to almost every language ever 0_0. So i learned more from audio only for quite some time. Then when i could afford language books at Barnes and Noble i'd buy a book for whatever language i wanted to learn at the time. But books don't have audio and often don't have visuals. So good luck with Thankfully this game gives you both a visual and a voice to learn from. And from my experience with the Japanese language, the voice sounds like a real Japanese person saying the word. I even tested it on some words i already knew such as 'Hashi' (chopsticks) 'fraipan' (frying pan) and 'terebi' (TV). So far the words are totally accurate and i feel like i'm learning :D I even let my younger siblings play the game for a while and he picked up some words too, even messed around with the game's camera to look for words. Sadly, though i am learning quite a lot and having fun re-freshing my Japanese vocabulary the game is mostly just for Expanding your vocabulary and knowledge of WORDS. You won't be learning any helpful phrases or learn how to form sentences. The apartment of the inventor in this game can also start feeling claustrophobic at times because you'll end up running around the same 4 rooms looking for words to learn. I tried to open the door out of the apartment but it won't open. It's a shame because i want to learn more words. There's only so much that can help you expand your vocabulary when you're limited only the the apartment setting. And if the game were expanded and you could open the door to the outside of the apartment THERE'S THE POTENCIAL FOR LEARNING MORE WORDS! Like what's the Japanese word for 'resturaunt' or 'laundramat' or 'hospital'? THERE'S SO MUCH MORE POTENCIAL IF YOU COULD EXIT THE APARTMENT SETTING! And think about the potencial for mini-games! Instead of just 'Time Attack' you could enter a restruant and learn what specific dishes are called or try to order food in that language, or you could go to a hospital for a check up and learn phrases specific to that enviornment. That's the only bad thing i have to say about the game. If you could exit the apartment in the game there'd be so much more potencial and new words to discover. If not patching it into the game, i won't mind paying for it as DLC. It could be like an 'Around the Town' pack or something like that. So until that comes out, i will recommend this game but don't expect it to make you an expert at whatever language you want to learn. It will teach you some helpful words but no phrases and the setting can feel claustrophobic after a while. I give this game planes out of 5\n",

      "It's rather daunting to speak about a legend like Braid. Many credit it as the reason the indie game Renaissance kicked off in the first place, and whether you believe that's a fair read or overreaching a bit, there's no question that Braid played a formidable role in the advancement of the indie game market, and the role of indie game as 'art film,' not 'demo Braid succeeded financially and critically. Braid opened people's eyes to the idea of the indie game as a form of expression, and the validity, and necessity, of games that don't follow a formula or sort neatly into a category. To call Braid merely a 'platformer' is to miss the point entirely. Most of what I'd like to say about Braid falls under the realm of spoilers -- it's a very hard game to talk about, without not only entering spoiler territory, but asserting one's own theories about what happens in it, what the player is seeing, what the events depicted in the game really mean. Braid is a game to be interpreted, to be meditated a game to be engaged with blind forward momentum. Speedrunning through Braid would be a terrible waste of the experience, at least until the game's events are well known to the player. Let me try to delicately walk the line of preserving Braid's many secrets, while sharing enough of the game to help demonstrate why it shines. From a mechanical perspective, Braid is a sidescrolling platformer. Your protagonist Tim runs, climbs, jumps and falls in a manner immediately familiar to the player. Upon his first death, however, we learn that we have the power to reverse time, and by holding down a key, rewind the game back to the point of decision and try again. We can do this as often as we like, reverse every mistake made, every mistimed jump, every unsuccessful stab at a puzzle, if we wish. Indeed, the game makes clear that this is not only our power as player, but Tim's own power, and that he's done this, over and over, in his own life. The puzzles encountered begin to incorporate Tim's power, requiring one to play with the flow of time to solve them, at this point. The puzzles are clever and fun, and finally figuring them out is quite rewarding, but they are, like the puzzles of Thomas Was Alone, merely a macguffin to draw the player into Tim's world, into his head, and into his way of thinking. The game is a philosophical reflection upon what it means to be Tim, to have this power, and to look at the world the way he does. Braid engaged by its mechanics is a clever and interesting experience, but Braid engaged in the context of its meaning, of what it might be saying 'between the lines' -- that's what makes it a must-have game. Enter Braid with the idea that the game is just an excuse to have a very interesting conversation with its creator about human agency, mistakes, regret, and the nature of interpersonal relationships. Be ready for the game to throw you some ferocious curveballs, and for you not to be satisfied with its story as a story in itself -- rather, for the story to be a vehicle that brings you to a new vantage point, from which to examine your own ideas of human agency, cause, effect, and meaning. Braid left me with a head full of thoughts about the way memory fails us, and the places in which wishful thinking seeps into the jars of our memories we thought were watertight, and spoils the things we imagined were well-preserved forever. It asks us, at the beginning, to imagine a world in which forgiveness is absolute, where mistakes can be erased, leaving no mark upon the future. Trial with ever-mitigatable, never lasting error sounds the game will, eventually, force you to confront the consequences of such a world, and to the temptation to mistake uncomfortable truths and reality for Surprising narrative power, for a cartoonish platformer with liberal nods back to the Super Mario Brothers franchise. If you're looking for a clever platform-puzzle game, Braid will fit the you'll be missing so much of what makes it special to engage it simply as a platform-puzzle game. Braid is a story, an inner journey, into the meaning of human agency, of love, loss, mistakes, lessons learned, and the nature of why time and causality work the way they do, told through a deceptively simple run-and-jump game with unlimited continues. If you're the sort who wants the game to applaud and cheer you for winning, you're exactly the sort of person Braid wants to you're going to be disappointed, in the end. That's okay. Weather the disappointment. Braid is talking to you; let it speak. Embrace your own discomfort with the things Braid has to say. Listen, and stop rewinding time to see if it'll say what you want to hear. Its message is not a 'mistake' to be \n",

      "Coming from the people who brought you the Driver and Destruction Derby series, at least before they were absorbed by Ubisoft, Reflections brings us this small Unity engine release Grow Home, a physics based platformer where you control a robot named and must grow a small plant large enough to reach your home ship. Gameplay is really intuitive, left and right triggers on the controller control your left and right arms, when you are near any surface you will latch onto it, allowing you to easily climb, all you must do is grab hold of branches of the Star Plant, named Star Shoots, and grow them into surrounding platforms, causing main plant to grow from the energy inside and get closer to your ship, which all seems quite easy and it is, the game never really becomes difficult or frustrating. Along the way you will pick up crystals that give you power-ups such as a jet pack to help you get a bit of a boost, and you can find plants to help slow your fall or glide along the sky, making it really easy to get around and even save yourself if you accidentally physics yourself off a platform. Overall Grow Home doesn't really have a whole lot going for it in terms of content, I got all the achievements and finished the game in just under five hours, but for those five hours I was greatly entertained, the climbing feels natural and fun, there are many caves to explore and things to collect, and the art style of the game feels like candy for the eyes, overall I recommend this game wholeheartedly for anyone looking to lose themselves in a fun little platformer for a while.\n",
      "Well, what to say about Grow Home? In Grow Home you play as BUD (Botanical Utility Droid), a robot on a mission to save his home planet by harvesting the seeds of a giant alien plant, thats basically your main goal, you make the plant grow, to go to other islands and get cristals, which give you more abilities and you keep growing the plant untill you reach the space ship. Its a fun game, i really enjoyed it, i hope it gets an DLC or a sequel in the future :) I totally recommend this game :) 10/10\n",
      "Grow Home is a fun game about a robot trying to grow a plant to the sky for research of the planet's resources? The game never tells you why you are growing the plant or anything, but it doesn't matter. Gameplay consists of climbing, Hunting for crystals, walking, climbing, and growing the plant by riding 'star shoots' or the attachments, into floating islands to claim nutrients for your plant to grow. I recommend this game if you can find it for a cheap price. My only complaints: -No music (minor) -Annoying if you fall of while doing something, resulting in a waste of time -Very very short I didn't like Grow Home at first, but it started to 'grow' on me. 8/10. Don't expect to get over 15 hours in this try it otherwise!\n",
      "*Skip to the bottom of the review for Tl:dr* Grow home is a charming platformer from Reflections, a Ubisoft Studio. Released on Steam in February, it was received to high praise almost unanimously. I gave it a download this weekend, and now feel compelled to talk about the charming platformer. Grow Home reminded me of Wall-E. You play as a lonely droid, BUD (Botanical Utility Droid), and MOM (missed what that stands for) drops you down onto a new planet. Your task is now to explore the planet’s biosphere and climb your way back to the mother ship by growing the star plant. The world centres around a large plant which has off-shoots with red flowers. By climbing up onto these you can make them grow, extending the size and reach of the main plant. Spread around the world are floating land masses, some of which have glowing green bottoms. These provide power, and it’s your task to grow the off-shoots into these to receive their power. Doing this X times will cause the main plant to grow another stage, moving you ever-closer to the mothership. It’s a simple premise, which could feel repetitive if not done correctly, but the charm of the world and novel controls negate that. The character controls somewhat like a ragdoll; it’s very reminiscent I Am Bread. You control each arm of the character with a different trigger, and direct him with the analogue stick. It feels great when you get into a nice rhythm, working your way up towards the mothership, but it does have a minor camera issue. For the most part the camera works great, but I did find myself sometimes babysitting it as the structure around me grew more complex. The game recommends using the gamepad, and I listened, so all my comments should be disregarded for keyboard controls as I’m sure it feels very different. At various heights throughout the level there are teleporters to be found. These allow you fast-travel between land masses at different heights. There’s also no punishment for dying. BUD dies from substantial fall damage, however if you do so you’re simply returned to the last teleporter you used. These two things mean there’s no punishment for exploring and taking risks. If you want to attempt a crazy jump between branches you can. If you don’t make it you can try again. I love this about the game. It encourages exploration and doing crazy things, ready for when you make mistakes. The main objective of the game is to grow the main plant and reach the mothership, but there’s lots to do in the world around you besides that. Throughout the world there are a number animals and plants to be found, some that require a lot of exploration to find! A running task is to find them all and bring them to a teleporter so MOM can scan them. Doing so will net you a new skin for BUD; there are other skins that can be unlocked by completing other tasks. There are also 100 crystals spread through the level. Some of these are really hard to find, and I found ~85 before resorting to a guide! Collecting these will unlock updates to BUD, giving you greater control over his movement. For example, when you reach around 60 crystals, you unlock a jetpack that gives you significantly more movement control. One of the main things I love about Grow Home is the environment itself. Low poly isn’t for everyone, but, when done right, minimalistic environment just look amazing. If ever I’d want to show somewhat what low poly should look like I’d point them towards Grow Home. It has so much charm and whimsy with the bright simple colours and shapes. Pair that with the underlying ambient soundtrack and it’s just an awesome environment. I do feel though that the relationship the player has with BUD could be greater. He is a cute little robot, but it doesn’t really go deeper than that. Like I mentioned earlier, it reminds me strongly of Wall-E, but you feel a lot more for Wall-E; you are always really routing for him. I didn’t feel that with BUD. He was merely a tool, a cute one, but nonetheless a tool in which I moved around the environment. I felt really warm and in-touch with the environment, but no so much BUD. Tl:dr – Grow Home is a charming platformer, with quirky controls and lovable protagonist. While short, and not without its minor issues such as camera control, its price and charisma overshadow these minor shortcomings to provide a wonderfully whimsical experience.

      "Give me a moment here, I want to make sure I don't miss any of these. Ahem: • WINNER: Indiecade Game Design, 2013 • WINNER: IGF | GDC Nuovo Award, 2011 • WINNER: Eurogamer Expo, RPS Indie Game of the Show, 2010 • WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Excellence in Design, 2010 • WINNER: Fantastic Arcade Bloodsport of the Year: 2010 • FINALIST: IGF | GDG Excellence in Design, 2011 • FINALIST: IGF | GDC Grand Prize, 2011 Those are the nominations and awards the newly released indie fighter, Nidhogg has listed on their home page. It was enough to make me pick it up without hesitation. I don't often define the quality of a video game by how many awards it's won, but when I start losing the ability to count them on my hands, apparently I do. A good thing, too. Nidhogg is all kinds of awesome. A DUEL TO THE DEATH The concept is remarkably simple: 2 players go head-to-head in a half duel/half race to the death, both equipped with fencing swords and capable of more than a few tricks to give an edge in battle. You begin facing your opponent in the 'middle' of a map, with an opening battle. Battles are fast and furious beyond imagining, often ending within a few seconds, which ties into the gameplay mechanic wonderfully: upon killing your opponent they'll need to wait a moment to respawn, allowing you to press forward toward your 'goal'. Win a battle and you're given the 'goal light' allowing you to move forward further; lose, and your opponent gains it instead. So long as you maintain the previous kill you can pass-by your opponent without engaging and edge closer to your goal - should they fail to stop your approach. This 'tug-o-war' mechanic is the single most endearing indie game element I've felt in a while. It's relentless, and the feeling of achievement after finally managing to push an opponent back to the end, before summarily being eaten by Nidhogg, is one of much glory and admiration. Simple, sure. But so very, very rewarding. Easy to learn, too, and likely near-impossible to master. MATCH MADE IN HELL Single-Player Mode consists of fighting steadily more challenging opponents, one after another, on one of 4 maps. So, naturally, if you want to be playing Nidhogg for more than a few hours, you're going to need to go multiplayer. Sadly, the online matchmaking within Steam isn't great. Assuming you can actually find a game, there's a good chance one of you will be lagging horribly — and when you're playing the type of game that you can't play with even the slightest amount of lag, matches can often lead to aggravating experiences. Assuming you have a few friends playing, and you're all within the same global region, this won't be a huge problem. And if you're lucky enough to have more than a few friends playing, then Tournament Mode will likely give you the greatest experience of all. I know, personally, playing live on Twitch, that this feature will make for 99% of all my time playing. WORTH A BUY? At $15~ I can only recommend a purchase here for players with friends planning to play with them - for now, at least. Which is largely a shame, as the gameplay offered in Nidhogg is truly exceptional. Possible improvements include visual upgrades to characters to simulate some form of character progression; as it stands, every game is the same and with 4 maps there's limited variety. You'll be relying on your opponents to entertain you; if they do, you're going to love Nidhogg, if not, you're likely going to get very bored, very quick.

      "Nidhogg is a great multiplayer game, but it may likely only be worth it for you if you have a friend who can play it with you in person, the online is broken and nearly dead. The single player can help you learn the basics of combat, and can be a refreshing way to just fool around for a few minutes whenever you feel like it, but the meat of the game is in multiplayer, and right now the online feels dead and lags too much to enjoy consistant fair matches. Nidhogg's gameplay is fast paced, fair, and rewards creativity and skill. You will probably enjoy how the match goes too much to have hard feelings over winning or losing. Each match is played on one of 4 stages, each with 5 screens, one neutral screen and two screens for each player. Each player has an unlimited stock of lives, the goal isn't to kill your opponent but to reach the end of your opponent's last screen, killing them simply makes it harder for them to stop you. There is no skill floor or base APM that you need to meet to compete, no ganking or equipment advantage in Nidhogg, each player has only their foil and their wits as tools to reach their goal. Many times you may lose to an opponent only to find yourself learning a new technique or tactic to add to your toolbox, making playing against a more skilled opponent a much less daunting experience than in other games. Roping your friends in to play with you as your opponent doesn't feel like a chore or unreachable task if they have no knowledge base or skill in the genre, since they will pick up very quickly on the intuitive controls and learn how to play from simple observation. TLDR: Nidhogg is a game that feels perfectly easy to play and difficult to master, but at the same time avoids many problems of more hardcore dedicated multiplayer games that have the same strengths, and never comes off as unfair or unfun. If you have a friend to play against, or can nab Nidhogg in a sale I strongly recommend trying it. The game is bare bones, but the gameplay itself is fantastic and intuitive.\n",
      " Ziggurat: Created by Milkstone Studios, Ziggurat is a first person shooter with rogue-like elements in which you play an apprentice wizard in training who must face the final test in order to become one of the brothers of Daedolon. That final test is the Ziggurat, a massive magic “dungeon” you must pass or die trying. First thing I’d like to share is that this game looks fantastic. There is so much color in this game! The style is quite different, I can’t quite put my finger on it but, it reminds me of Fable for some reason. All the environments, the lighting, spells and weapons you use have wonderful affects and the overall look of the game is amazing, I really love the graphics here in this game, it makes me wish there were more to see or an adventure to go on in this world. Usually I like to also include music with the overall style but here the music is average, it isn’t bad, just standard. The rogue-like elements in this game are the usual random rooms, weapons, enemies, loot, bosses and so forth. In fact the different types of rooms and the way they work reminds me a lot of the Binding of Isaac, some rooms will have you take a gamble in spending life or mana for potential gain or loss. Some will have treasure chest at the end of an Indiana Jones type room filled with either traps or a jumping puzzle in a room of lava. There is good variety here so traversing the Ziggurat shouldn’t feel too derivative. There is a lot to unlock in this game, however, you can actually beat the final boss in just an hour or two, the dungeons are pretty short so be expecting to go through multiple ziggurat runs to unlock everything. A sort of missed opportunity is having the final boss be something different or, adding more levels of the ziggurat every time you play through it so that each play through feels very different and to give more of a sense of progression. The games story is all frontloaded at the beginning cinematic and at the end of the Ziggurat, the game is entirely based on its combat. The combat is very reminiscent of games like the Unreal Tournament series or Quake Arena. The game relies on you to be fast and dodge all incoming projectiles, the more skillful you are in this the more successful you will be at the game. Weapons also lend to reminding me of Unreal Tournament, with all the weapons in the game having a main firing mode and an alternative firing mode, all this combined makes the combat feels very fast paced and chaotic, and pure fun. I really enjoyed myself with Ziggurat, its an amazing game for only USD. I hope this isn’t Milkstone Studios last game, I’d like to see Ziggurat get the Diablo 2 treatment, same world, similar style but completely cranked up, keeping the combat and adding in more role-playing elements and maybe a world to explore. I don’t say this often, this game is also great for kids, it isn’t overly easy or hard, its got great challenge, not super intense or gory, it’s just a solid gaming experience for all. TL/DR; Ziggurat is a solid first person rogue-like shooter, you play a wizard with bombs, spells, magic staffs and your trusty wand. Pass the trial of the Ziggurat or die trying. With beautiful graphics and good old fashioned, fast action combat you can’t go wrong dropping for this wonderful indie. I look forward to more games from Milkstone Studios. -Thumbs up from Royial Video Reviews can be found at: \n",
      "Nidhogg is a fast paced, local multiplayer focused fencing game developed by Messhof. In Nidhogg you take up fencing and fight one on one matches against AI or other players through local or online multiplayer. The aim of the game is to make it past your opponent and run to the other side of the map. +Awesome pixel graphics +Simple gameplay, all you have to do is stab your opponent and run to the other side of the map, it might sound boring but it's actually really entertaining, especially when playing with friends +The different maps are very different to each other which provides some nice variation for the game +Nidhogg can be enjoyed in Singleplayer, Local Multiplayer and Online Multiplayer/Matchmaking +The fast-paced side-scrolling nature of Nidhogg makes it perfect for playing in Local Multiplayer and things get pretty intense, making Local Multiplayer pretty exhilirating and the best way to enjoy the game +Nidhogg features a tournament mode which allows 3-8 players to play Local Multiplayer +The soundtrack is great and fits with the game well +The fighters in the game are all brightly coloured and blood basically acts like paint for the maps so you end up with some pretty cool designs on the floor if one area of the map gets particularly bloody +Both the KB&M controls and the 360 Gamepad controls are very good and very responsive -Nidhogg has a severe lack of content due to only having four maps, for that kind of content really isn't good enough -Singleplayer gets repetitive (thanks to the lack of content) very quickly -Until recently Online Multiplayer wasn't very good (due to lag mainly) but it has been fixed, sadly it would seem not many people who own Nidhogg know that it was fixed since the game's Online Multiplayer remains pretty much dead Verdict: Highly Recommended, but Only When Discounted Nidhogg is a great, fast paced fighting game with awesome graphics and simple gameplay, sadly the game is very much let down by its lack of content and high asking price. If you're looking for what is one of the best Local Multiplayer games on Steam and you don't mind paying the high price then give Nidhogg a go, if not, wait for a sale. No drama, Just Reviews.

      "Disclaimer: I've played the free versions of this series for more than 300 hours, probably near 400. (about half of it spent with Gemcraft Labyrinth). Gemcraft has always been my favourite tower defense game by far, the difference between this series and any other TD is just ridiculous. Main reasons why I love this series as a whole: Pause button and ability to act during pause . I hate TD's where I need to act quickly. This allows me to think about what to do at any time I want to. Pretty much everything has a hotkey , which makes the gameplay a bit smoother compared to clicking everything. You're always doing something. It's really rare that you get through a wave without building or doing some micromanagement with your towers. The math in the game. Everything is told with calculatable numbers. I hate TD's that only tell something like 'A high damage, low speed missile tower' with no numbers to tell me what it really does. 148 levels. This is not some basic 'get high score in these 10 levels' tower defense, but it has a story/lore, hidden stuff, multiple ways of progression/upgrades, etc. The insanely good difficulty scaling. It's not an automatic scaling, but I can choose how difficult I want the game to be. At easiest, it's pretty easy (and boring) to be honest. But you can adjust stuff that changes the gameplay a lot like 'next wave comes faster', 'you gain mana in waves instead of a constant stream', 'faster scaling', 'reduced effect of Slow', and of course, endurance mode in any level. You can enable multiple different things at once, and harder settings means more exp = more skills = you can go for even higher difficulty. Difficulty scaling from 'easier than breathing' to 'failed in first wave' also means that this game has a difficulty for anyone. Want casual click-and-watch-explosions? You got it. Want to see how long you can survive against impossible odds? You got it. Every fail is caused by you and you only. The problem I see with most TD's is the situation where you think 'I have no idea which order I should build these towers to complete this level'. But because of the difficulty scaling and the complexity of the game in general, I've never had that feeling in Gemcraft. The difficulty scaling causes me to always try harder settings before hitting a wall of 'oh sh*t I went too high' like that damn Icarus. But because it was my own choice to begin with, it's just a facepalm moment and retry, instead of feeling that the game is peeing in my cereals. Continuing with difficulty scaling: even in mid-fight, you can make any wave of monsters harder by spending mana on it . Killing these waves rewards you with even more mana, but doing this requires you to really know your limits: anger them too much and they'll eat you alive. Using this mechanic is pretty much required to beat the hardest levels and difficulties, and it turns the game to a constant balancing of 'how much can I take?'. This mechanic is unique among the TD's that I've played, and it's also one of the many reasons I love this game. The usual 'get a bonus by sending in the next wave earlier' is there aswell. The whole series is pretty much like Dark Souls of the tower defense genre. If you get into it, you'll say that it's the best one. The caveat is that it isn't the easiest game to get into, and it isn't for everyone. The free version of this game can be found at . I'm not even sure what's the difference because I bought this edition instantly after noticing it's on Steam. But I'd say go try the free one, and if you notice that you run out of content before getting bored with the game, come back here. TL;DR: In the end it's still a tower defense game, but it's filled with loads of unique ideas/mechanics and everything is polished to the limit and above. For me it's the game that made every other TD suck just because they aren't nearly as good as Gemcraft.\n",
      "Gemcraft series is the ultimate Tower Defense experience for me, and 'Chasing Shadows' is the best instalment so far. At first glance it may work and look like a standard TD game - monsters enter the map in waves, walk to our base along predefined paths and we have to defend it by building towers and traps, as well as occasionally using some spells. However, not only Gemcraft does it superbly but it also offers depth and complexity you won't find in most TD games. The most unique and fun feature of the game, in my opinion, is the wave angering. Player can spend some mana to make monster waves stronger (by increasing monster numbers and stats), which allows you to gain more mana and experience from killing the IF you can kill them that is. This one feature changes the gameplay from simple defense to the 'how far can I push it' competition. Another feature, which adds extra replayability value, is the ability to customize levels. It's pretty fun to return to some of early levels later in the game to see how much stronger you have become by beating the level with some extra difficulty settings. You can add more waves, make monsters stronger, faster, tougher or tweak some game rules to get a harder map with higher experience multiplayer. Ah, the experience - player character can gain levels and unlock various skills and spells which will increase his efficiency in killing monster filth. There is no level cap, however some skills (not all) have a limit to which they can be improved. Add to it a wizard's talisman which can be socketed with talisman fragments gathered along your journey and you get quite a few ways of progressing, improving and specialising your character. However, Gemcraft originally being a flash game, has some shortcomings. To many people graphics would be the biggest one. Despite it being pretty 'clean', readable and fitting the game's darker theme, it's still 2D graphics in low resolution without all those fireworks that other games have nowadays. Personally I prefer it that way, but to each his own. I have spent dozens of hours (flash version on ArmorGames, so obviously Steam won't show this time) with this game and can safely recommend it to other Tower Defense games fans. If you are unsure then you may try the free version of the game on ArmorGames to see if you like it. In any case be advised that GemCraft is not a game you can finish in a few hours. There are dozens of levels and some of the later ones can take as much as an hour to finish.\n",
      "Overview Magicite is a rogue like platformer that has a mix of survival and exploration elements mixed in. The games developers SmashGames have create a game that is not only fun to play but challenging if not downright merciless. The game was originally on steams early access but has since left but is still updated with the funds that were raised on Kickstarter. Story Magicite doesn’t really have a story. But townsfolk that can be found between the levels can be spoken to and can give you a bit of info about the world. Gameplay Magicite seem to draw idea and concepts of other game, the platforming from games like Spelunky and the survival system from Minecraft as well as some RPG elements. The first thing that the player is required is to create is their character. At first the level of choice the player has is very limited with only two different hairstyle and the ability to roll a dice to determine what stats and the two random traits they will receive. After a few good play through, other options will be unlocked such as new races, hats and companions that can give some extra buffs and make the game easier. Different races have a different set of starting gear. Hats have special effect and companions will provide passive effects. After the player create their character they are dropped into a forest biome with the starting item of their race. Every level is randomly generated when a level is completed the player will be given a choice of three other biomes which are also randomly generated. Player can visit towns in between levels were item can be bought or sold as well as craft new ones. When the player level up that gain more stat points and with be able to skills from skill trees melee, magic and ranged. Player can have three skill and they are given to them randomly. Player must collected resources to craft new tool to help in the higher level as well to help manage hunger. Crafting is easy to make an item you must combine two other items. They are not many recipes so they are easy to learn and you just need better material to make better items. Magicite is an unforgiving game health pools are few and far between and potion are rare. Playing with friend can make it easier because downed player can be revived by another player. However the reviver is left vulnerable for about three second. The controls for Magicite are for keyboard and mouse only, the keyboard for moving and the mouse for interacting and aiming. The control are very responsive which is so important in a platformer with this level of difficulty. Visuals Magicite has a very retro feel with it simple 16-bit graphics and bright and vibrant colours, with the games background being as dark as it is make the colours stand out even more. The game can scale to high resolution without any problem. Audio The Audio like the visuals has a very retro 16-bit feel. However the is no menu music which is a little strange but once in the game the music is great. Overall I love the game from it brutal difficulty to its retro art style and soundtrack the game has so much replay ability, and with the controls being as responsive as they are SmashGames have created something that mixes survival, RPG, roguelike and platforming into something truly great. Anybody that likes a challenge, platformers or just like to play game with some friends or by your self should definitely give this game a go. \n",
      "I recently discovered Magicite, a cool horizontal scrolling platform game blending some RPG and crafting elements, with combat and magic. I’ve always been a fan of the ‘sideways scroller’, from Super Mario Bros. to R-Type (I would add Jet Set Willy here but it’s room-based and not strictly a scrolling landscape…) and the simple mechanics of running, jumping and picking stuff up is forever engraved on the fabric of the gaming universe. The beauty here is the Magicite world is procedurally generated – not a new concept in games but it creates a wonderfully unique environment each time, albeit a very familiar one, with platforms, monsters, chests, trees and other resources with which to interact. Oh and Magicite is a Rogue-like game. So when you dead… you dead. Each level in Magicite is one of a limited set of ‘biomes’ – forest, swamp, fire-land each with different creatures and hazards. In single player, it can be fiendishly difficult particularly if you get a bad level generation (lots of monsters and not much space to manoeuvre) but once you get started and build up a stash of items, weapons and armour, you’re on your way. You can chop trees to collect wood and sticks, turn the wood into planks and the sticks into handles, turn the planks into blades and make tools and weapons: axes, picks and swords. Then you can mine stone, and iron, gold and diamond to make better tools and weapons… and armour. The better the tools, the more resources you get. The better the armour, the more likely you are to survive. And creatures can drop hide and pelt, food to eat and other useful things. Your character needs to eat regularly as well as keep their health topped up with potions. At the end of each level is a choice of three doorways. The doorway you choose decides the next level so it’s best to stick to forests or swamps for the first few so you can build up resources and items, and have a fighting chance of making it to the end. In between levels are ‘towns’; safe (ish) areas for buying and selling, crafting metal bars and making armour and clothing. It is probably important to say at this point that Magicite has some vague archetypes for developing characters. You can focus on melee combat and make metal armour (fighter), or make bows and arrows and hide armour (ranger), or make wands and cloth armour (wizard); all these things can affect your stats, how much damage you inflict, and can take, how fast you move and your magical ability. Progression through levels also increases these things depending on your race and other abilities. To start with, you are limited to one race but a neat achievement system unlocks different races, variants, hats (oh yes) and companions which become available for your next run. Another feature, one that is intensely annoying to start with, is the Scourge. If you spend too long on a level, a nasty monster turns up and beats the crap out of you – unless you get to one of the doorways. This gives a sense of urgency and propels you through the levels, creating a fast and often chaotic game. It has a multi-player mode which is when the game comes alive. Even playing with one other person improves the game considerably. One of you can focus on wood while the other is the miner, one can be melee while the other is ranged. The magic side is probably the most difficult to master but very powerful. You have to collect bugs (using nets made from sticks and spider webs) to make gems with which to craft wands. Some things need NPCs (metal bars, cloth) but most things can be combined by hand and on-the-fly as you fight through levels. There are a few ‘bosses’ in Magicite. Destroying spider nests will inevitably spawn a brood mother – this is pain at the start but soon you will be destroying every nest you can find to increase your loot, and a final boss can be found on the last level. I’ve been lucky enough to complete Magicite a few times in multi-player (with a lot of help!) and this will unlock some of the powerful achievements. It would be great to see Magicite expand into a more complex game, especially the crafting which is very limited, while retaining its simple concept. More variety and unique items would be great, like the wand that generates zombies, as well as more weapons and armour. The game could also use a few new biomes with more variety but overall it’s a great concept, fun to play and challenging.\n",

      "Sequel to Hexcells , Hexcells Plus offers more of the same as the original, excellent logic puzzler but with considerably more challenge. This can be both a good and a bad thing. Because of the higher challenge level, I strongly recommend you to first play the original Hexcells. Game has changed little from the original Hexcells. User interface (UI) is exactly the same as before. Just like in Hexcells, you have to deduce whether hexes are blue or black based on simple rules similar to Hanjies and Mine Sweeper. However, the puzzles are completely new. The sequel adds one new mechanic: now blue cells can also have a number on them that dictates how many hexes in two cells' radius are blue. Still no guessing is required at all: everything can be logically deduced. Music has changed a bit but it retains the ambient theme from the original. Just like in Hexcells, there are 36 well-designed, challenging puzzles. Unlike Hexcells, the challenge level jumps up very quickly, and the further you get, the longer the puzzles will take to complete (assuming you are not guessing and strive for perfection). Coming straight from Hexcells it's alright but starting out it would be a bit too much. Especially the new mechanic of numbered blue cells can make it difficult to understand what's going on, though the UI has a convenient helping function to keep your thoughts straight. Unfortunately at least I had to resort to the infamous 'try and exclude' deduction strategy way more often in this sequel than in the original game, so the puzzles can drag a lot longer. The lack of saving option within puzzles can become a drag if you find yourself in a hurry. I still recommend Hexcells Plus to anyone who liked the original Hexcells and was left craving for more. The upped difficulty level is more hardcore though and I can't emphasize this quality too much. For me the game took some 10 hours to complete fully, while original Hexcells was just a 2-hour stroll. If you want a smoother difficulty curve and a more pleasant a sequel considering the difficulty level, you should skip straight to Hexcells Infinite that also finally adds saves and random levels. In that effect Hexcells Plus shares many problems of its predecessor: it has limited content that lacks replayability after being completed and saving feature before that. However, it also shares most of its virtues: well-designed, albeit (perhaps) too challenging puzzles (when compared to the original one) with pretty much perfect user interface and audiovisual outlook for its game type. For challenge's sake it continues from where Hexcells was left so in that effect it is also a fine sequel for the puzzle enthusiast.\n",
      "I have already played 'Hexcells Plus' which is the second part of the trilogy. I must say that 'Hexcells' is significantly easier than 'Hexcells Plus'. Took me less than 2 hours to complete it but it's an awesome puzzle game and I can't wait to play the third part (Hexcells Infinite). Got both 'Hexcells' and 'Hexcells Infinite' games on sale. If you like puzzle games I recommend you to buy the trilogy if you have enough funds. :)\n",
      "Traditional Rating - 94/100 Recommendation - Like Hexcells, but Plus! Remember the free old Windows game Minesweeper? Remember how fun it was finding those hidden mines, and how you could feel your brain scream 'NOOOOOOOOOOO' whenever a mine would pop its stupid head up and kill you? Remember how immensely frustrating it was when it was entirely impossible to solve levels without guessing? WELL, NO MORE! Hexcells to the rescue. Hexcells is very similar to Minesweeper in that you have to use various clues and reasoning to find the hidden blue cells on each level, but unlike Minesweeper, Hexcells' soultions can ALWAYS be reasoned, and if you're doing it right you will never have to guess. The levels start out easy, with simple rules and puzzles, but new tricks are added just regularly enough to fully grasp, and before you know it, you'll find yourself scanning through 15 different criteria to find the 1-in-100 blue cell to start a level off. It's very satisfying. Speaking of satisfying, the puzzles here never seem overwhelming or too tricky. Take my opinion with a grain of salt (since I have always loved games like this), but the level of difficulty in these puzzles was just perfect, and while some levels did force me to stare at them for a while, the solution was always there somewhere just waiting for me to grab it. The Hexcells series is really 3 games: Hexcells, Hexcells Plus, and Hexcells Infinite. They each have different puzzles, and they are each worth getting, but Hexcells Infinite is the one to get if you're on a budget. It has the most advanced puzzles, and it includes a random level generator, so you can literally play to your heart's content. All 3 of them will slowly progress you through the mechanics of the game, though, so don't feel like you will be overwhelmed if you jump right into Infinite. It's worth mentioning that the random levels in Infinite are mere pale shadows compared to the premade levels (they are often quite easy), but for fans that cannot get enough and don't want to go back to the guess-fest Minesweeper, they can be a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game. If you're a fan of logic-based puzzle games, you can't go wrong with any of these 3 games. The prices are cheap, and the series is rather unique. If the devs could have just tightened up the infinite level generator ever-so-slightly, this game might be the only game I've rated to pass Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. Scratch that Minesweeper itch, my friend!\n",
      "At first I thought that the Hexcells series were minesweeper clones. However, the later puzzles introduced some mechanics that made things more complex. As someone who enjoyed playing minesweeper, this was a very nice game. This one is a continuation of the original Hexcells and Hexcells Plus, and is actually harder in my opinion. Further, Hexcells Infinite has a random puzzle generator, hence the Infinite in the name. So if you are thinking of getting only one Hexcells game, this is the one to get. It also has a slightly better UI than the earlier two games.\n",

      "There was a bit of time in 2011-2015 where I was fully obsessed with this game and the obsession came to a head in Late September 2014 when after 2 months of designing and running reactors on paper, an iPad and an Android tablet (usually simultaneously) where I finally beat the last level of the main campaign from scratch with absolutely no outside assistance. (Took a few months to recover before uploading my designs to I own SpaceChem and 63 Corvi on Android, iOS, and PC (Both on steam and DRM free). 3 SpaceChem t-shirts, all of the swag you can imagine that was created by Zachtronics for the game and I have easily over 4000 hours played across all platforms (not to mention the ridiculous amount of time I spent doodling and planning on chemistry lab graph paper). With that out of the way here's a review: Warning, this game is not for hardcore puzzle game fans. This game is specifically for those who need to be obsessed with puzzles to the point of tryharding. Have you ever thought you could beat Tetris? Have you ever actually beaten Tetris? That's what playing SpaceChem feels like. SpaceChem is incredibly tedious and it will cause you mental anguish to the point where you might have a nervous breakdown. Need proof? Here's the statistics of people who actually complete the game: (Without Guides) Image courtesy: / You'll note that the further players get in the game the less they want/are able to finish it. In other words it is truly an incredibly humbling experience insofar as measuring your own intelligence. It's like an IQ test, if you apply yourself you will succeed, if you're haphazard about it (Like using guides or other players solutions) you will still succeed but it will make it much much easier than if you had just tried on your own. Most levels in this game have hundreds of millions of potential ways to solve EACH SECTION of the puzzle. If you try you will complete every level it is just a matter of designing your solutions. I know my summary score and my personal score don't add up, but this game is a 5/5. it is a masterpiece and just because the audio/story/visuals aren't 'the best' it is a legendary game and deserves no less than a perfect score. Audio: 3/5 - Adequate Graphics: 4/5 - Sensible and useful but still a little confusing at points. Story: 2/5 - Not really inspiring or terrible but below average for necessity.

      "SpaceChem is a really excellent puzzle game—if “puzzle game” is even the right way to describe it (more on this in a moment). It casts the player as an engineer working for an outer-space industrial operation—your job is to program and arange the reactors that recombine chemical elements for various industrial purposes. Right up front it’s worth noting that SpaceChem isn’t actually a chemistry game. Ignorance of actual chemistry isn’t a hindrance. The actual game play consists of setting up tracks which carry chemical components around within a reactor, and inserting commands to make sure that what you want ends up where you want it. In some stages there is a further level of complexity where you must set up and connect multiple reactors to be used together. All this has a lot more to do with computer programming than it does which chemistry. In fact, it seems fair to say that SpaceChem is like the fun part of programming separated from all the arcane knowledge and headache that go along with it. You are, in essence, issuing simple commands to a machine to enable it to complete complex tasks. (People who have coded may also feel some déjà vu as they set about finding the bugs in the operation of reactors they’ve already set up—it feels just like debugging Here is where SpaceChem is so different from most other puzzle games. Instead of being faced with a problem to which you must FIND a solution, here you are faced with an objective and you must DESIGN a solution. These stages are less puzzles than engineering tasks. And possible approaches to the SpaceChem stages are innumerable and call on your creativity as much as your deduction. This is emphasized by the feedback you get once you’ve completed a stage which compares your solution to all the others on record along several dimensions. For me, this added an incentive not just to beat a level, but to keep returning to my solution: surely I could find a way to do it faster, or with fewer instructions than the others who’d solved it. Thus the replayability of even a single stage is vast. That is the real strength and focus of the game, the core structure of the problem solving. Some other elements are less strong. The visuals are very simple, though, for the most part, I think this brings an abstract elegance. The story, such as it is, is darkly comedic but tacked on and not really worth your attention. And the boss battles, essentially normal stages with some sort of twist in how you apply your chemistry, are awkward and un-compelling as if an afterthought to the game’s design. But these complaints are peripheral to the core excellence of the game as an opportunity for creative, structured problem solving. (And don’t take the creative bit to mean it isn’t challenging. The difficulty of the game has been widely noted. Things start off easily enough, but don’t feel bad if you find the later stages very challenging—you have a lot of So if you like puzzle games, coding, or a good challenge, SpaceChem is for you.

      "I backed the game for the basic tier during the Kickstarter campaign. Dropsy is a charming adventure game that aside from a few pixel hunting hiccups is a quality game. Dropsy may look like a creepy clown but all he wants to do is help people and his adventure is quite the heartwarming one as you can have Dropsy make everyone in his town feel better. With a great atmosphere and likable cast, Dropsy is a definitely an adventure game worth your time.\n",
      "Dropsy is a classic point-and-click adventure game but with some new and interesting ideas. The protagonist is Dropsy the Clown and you spread hugs and happiness. Dropsy cannot speak to anyone, so you have to figure out the puzzles by images. The game has a distinct visual art style and a lot of subtle humor. If you generally enjoy adventure games, you'll most likely be happy playing Dropsy. Check out my First Impressions here: \n",
      "Dropsy is a unique point and clck adventure. I loved everything about it. It has an original character in Dropsy the clown, who just want to help and befriend people, to make them happy. He is not alone in his quests and as his story progresses he will go through some challanges and grow as a character. The interface of the game does not contain any text, no any that you can read in some known language anyway. You'll have to make sense of pictograms, which is presumably how Dropsy perceives and/or senses people's (but not only people's) feelings/ needs/ mood. There are some other clever mechanics at work here, since you can use your companions to assist Dropsy in his quests and additionally Dropsy can hug almost everyone and everything! The game for the most part had quite a feel-good vibe going for it. The story will take some darker paths, eventually but there is always something positive or upbeat and it tries to never leave you in absolute depressive or bad mood. The puzzles are logic and most of them are of easy difficulty. The game's world and many characters are quite weird (in a way that reminded me of the classic LucasArt's Sam 'n Max). The story is interesting and it will leave quite an impression on you. The music is very fitting and well done. The pixel art and animations are great! I would absolutely recommend Dropsy to any point and click adventure game fan.\n",
      "(Review originally published on Gamemoir .) Dropsy is a bit difficult to describe in words. After all this game embraces “show, don't tell” by having absolutely zero dialogue or exposition. But as an advocate for the power and utility of words, I should probably give it a shot. Being nice is hard. For Dropsy though—the eponymous moist demonic-faced clown—it is simply second nature. He's the last innocent in a jaded world. By some sinister stroke of misfortune however, Dropsy's circus tent has burned down and the blame is pinned on him. Townspeople are quick to turn against him. It's up to Dropsy to prove their reactions wrong by performing good deeds—doing so only because that is simply Dropsy's way. One of the most interesting aspects of Dropsy's gamplay is its nonlinearity. An open world point-and-click adventure? Outrageous! By nonlinear I mean that almost the entire map is available to explore from the get-go. This is a questionable tactic for an adventure game, as it is overwhelming for the player to have so much immediately available. There's a reason after all why most adventure games are step-by-step structured—it is easier and more fluid for the player to process the information that way. Overlapping sidequests and mainquests mean a lot of inventory-collecting and information-gathering without a clear idea of how either is to be implemented. The result makes Dropsy suffer from a general lack of direction, the player not receiving much feedback from their actions nor gaining a definite sense of progress. Open world also means traversing the same maps over and over again, which can be repetitive. A day and night cycle makes the exploration even more daunting. Yet the charm and liveliness of the world is undeniable. An eclectic, catchy soundtrack complements the bright, vibrant visuals. The music ranges from hardcore punk to poppy little diddies, the musicians here composing fantastically low-fi representations of popular genres. Meanwhile the pixel art is beautiful, with a variety of unique settings and smooth animations. The characters are diverse and endearing. Three little critter buddies accompany you—a bird, a mouse and a dog (whose mission is ostensibly to pee on as many things as he can). Along the way, Dropsy also runs into an angry all-women punk band, a preacher who believes that rock music is the devil, a vampire-fearing cult and the corrupt CEO of a pharmaceutical pastry corporation. To name just a few. Dialogue is shown through visual symbols. For instance, a character complains about work. Instead of simply saying “I hate work,” the character's speech bubble has a little person with a shovel followed by a red circle with a cross through it. Nonverbal communication in an adventure is a phenomenal idea, performed well in the past by Machinarium. The difference here is that Machinarium had a very simple plot. Dropsy meanwhile is ceaselessly complicated. This demands a lot of attention on the part of the player. On its own this isn't asking too much—it only gets increasingly convoluted as we delver further into a plot involving aliens, conspiracy and evil corporations. Things get a little lost in translation. Dropsy also at times refuses to keep the player in the loop of its game world logic. Take, for example, when the player might want to enter the nightclub in town. As an adventure game, would we not want to explore every single possible location? Yet whenever the player tries to make Dropsy enter the club, he simply walks in front of it then shrugs. No clear indication of why he cannot enter is given. Other similar information is often failed to be communicated to the player—instead of explanations, we are often just met with a shrug. Despite problems with a sense of plot progression and generally just getting lost in the game world, there is an undeniable satisfaction to going around doing nice things for people and getting hugs. It is one of the purest examples of positive feedback in gaming—do good things and people will like you more, will want to support and assist you. Dropsy's rather horrifying appearance is ignored in lieu of his benevolent actions. It is heartwarming to see, both funny and touching. While Dropsy isn't quite as fun as it could have been, it does have its moments. Some puzzles, such as a sequence in which you must break into a building as a mouse, are quite challenging and clever. The world it builds is inimitable. It just doesn't flow as smoothly as it might—the player finds the narrative moving in jumps and starts, progressing almost accidentally as they stumble upon new information, collect a new item or else discover a new location. This can be frustrating to experience, make the game more tedious than need be. As a whole, though, there is nothing else like Dropsy out there. It has its shortcomings, but it is a one-of-a-kind, lovable, huggable experience. For that alone it is worth playing. A copy of the game was provided by the developer for review on PC.\n",

      "If you are looking for a good rhythm/music game on Steam look no further. Beat Hazard is quite possibly your best choice in this situation. As simple as it may look, Beat Hazard is an amazing game with a buttload of replay value. There is no plot besides a small explanation of what happens - you are a pilot of a spaceship and you have to survive other ships' attacks (and sometimes asteroids). There is a small catch though - everything is generated on the go from the loaded MP3 file . You choose your favorite song(s), load them up and blast! Everything depends on the song you chose - the more intense the music is at the moment, the faster and stronger your bullets get, the faster your enemies fly by etc. The game itself is, to be honest, kinda dull. The DLCs, however, are what really drives this game home. Cold Beam Games did an outstanding job on creating them. Beat Hazard Ultra is more of a full-blown expansion pack. It adds so many new things to the game (new enemies, new perks, new gamemodes you will forget what it was to play the vanilla game! Shadow Operations Unit is an excellent choice for people who always seek out to complete new objectives! This one adds new ships to control, each one differing in stats and overall gameplay, Workshop support and missions to complete (such as getting X points, destroying Y enemy ships). If you ever get in the mood to play your games to the rhythm of your music (and even if you're simply looking for a good game), I strongly recommend Beat Hazard. It's one of those cheaper games which actually can make a gamer stick with it for a long time. (For all of you lazy bums looking for a TL;DR: 10/10).\n",

      "The concept of LYNE is so simple that you will learn it watching the store page video or playing for first few puzzles, yet as you progress through the tier sets (which contain a massive 650 puzzles!), this simple concept turns into some very complex puzzle scenarios. Larger game grids, more colours/lines to connect or three-way instead of two-way blocks are some modifiers used throughout to increase the difficulty each set. Once you get into the second half of the game there are some real challenging levels that will leave you scratching your head for a long time (& occasionally swearing at your monitor)! To give you an example, here is some unedited footage of me trying to solve a more challenging level (mistakes and all!): Graphics are clear, mouse controls are intuitive, achievements & cards, and also has daily set challenges of randomly generated puzzles to test you further. The daily sets, plus the 650 standard puzzles is a huge amount of content for such a small price tag. There really isn't any negatives to this great little puzzle game, although if I was to be picky some of the colour pallette sets are a bit hard on the eyes :) Thankfully, not a big deal as you can set it to your liking once you unlock pallettes through game progression. If you like games that challenge your mind (& sometimes your sanity!) then LYNE is well worth checking out. If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! \n",
      "An intuitive little visual puzzle game, with a wonderful minimalist style, mellow soundtrack and engaging gameplay. LYNE is incredibly simple: join the dots, but with rules. Create lines on a grid joining matching coloured shapes, making sure not to miss any or leave any paths untravelled. Sounds easy? It’s not. Each Puzzle is part of a Set; 25 Puzzles to a Set, 26 Sets in the main Game, so 650 puzzles in just the main Game, which continues with new Daily Sets. As you progress through the sets, they increase in size and difficulty, getting very challenging; the daily sets can also vary in difficulty, so no day is the same. The elegant and abstract style of the game really helps to engage the player, focusing on just the puzzle, with no superfluous window dressing, just a simple layout and interface for such a devious challenge. It’s chilled out, almost zen-like, soundtrack also helps set the mood for a relaxed and engaging puzzle solving session. After I finish playing, I usually feel relaxed and focused; it’s almost meditative. The accessible play style makes the game great for casual gaming, able to drop in and out of gameplay whenever you like. You can hardcore through the game pretty quickly, but really, it’s made for casual play, whiling away 15-30 minutes here or there, enjoying soothing music and mentally challenging puzzles. LYNE has various achievements to unlock, as well as collectible triangles with each puzzle solved, which in turn unlock different colour palettes for the game dependent on amount of triangles collected, as well as unlocking hidden features such as a sub-game involving Twitter and a hidden cypher - I don’t use Twitter, so not too sure what’s involved there, but it’s cool that games are expanding to use social media in such ways. I bought this during the Xmas sale, after spotting a review that mentioned you could spell out words with the LYNE achievement badges - each Set is a Letter of the Alphabet, and each unlocked Achievement is a corresponding Letter Badge - and actually thought that was a worthwhile idea, but after playing it I’m glad I bought it, regardless, because it’s a great game for casual play. It’s immediately recognisable as similar in concept to various casual games on Mobile devices Flow), but none have pulled it off with the style and elegance of LYNE; it’s so pretty, simple and fun! Thumbs up, and definitely recommended!\n",
      "Puzzle games in my eyes need a few things to be entertaining, addicting tests of your wits. They should be easy to pick up, with basic rules that don’t require lengthy tutorials or wordy instructions to understand. They ought to be dynamic, built on a framework that can be easily reworked into a continual stream of interesting puzzles that don’t become repetitive despite being similar if not identical in design. And lastly I prefer them to be easy to pick up and put down, like a coffee table book that you can spend a few minutes or hours passing the time with, then set it back down for an unknown amount of time and still find it just as enjoyable the next time you look at it. LYNE seems to have unknowingly looked into my head and designed itself around these ideals, forming into a simple but exemplary brain teaser that I fell in love with from the very first screen. It’s a relaxing yet engrossing experience that excels at putting you in a zen like state as you clear puzzles and feel especially clever each and every time you do. In essence, LYNE can best be thought of as a nonlinear connect-the-dots. You’re given two points that you must connect, while going through all of the requisite points between them, but the order in which you do so is entirely up to you. There isn’t necessarily only one way to solve a puzzle, and this freedom is but one reason I find LYNE hugely refreshing compared to so many other puzzle games. As you progress you begin to deal with multiple colors, points you must repeatedly run through, and more complex designs that have you connecting lines like a mad cartographer, which from the outside looking on would seem highly complex and difficult. But, it never feels that way when you’re playing. The fundamentals are so basic that it feels almost innate, like you’ve already been doing this for years. Something about LYNE clicked with me instantly, allowing me to breeze through level after level without an abundance of difficulty but leaving that satisfying feeling of accomplishment when you flex your frontal lobe and solve a problem. The soothing ambient sounds and mellow colors do well to elicit a calm mindset, making this an ideal way to let loose of your tension and unwind as you focus on the problem at hand. In a similar way that many treat Sudoku and crossword puzzles, LYNE has something of a habitual quality; something you can go back to every day to help keep you sharp and relax after the more trying events of a day. The structure is tailor made for this style of play, with puzzles grouped into sets that are just long enough to be rewarding but not fatiguing. Random daily puzzles (though you’d never know that do to them being just as well designed as the base sets) provide consistent new content, at which point I can think of little more I could ask for. Brilliant, Thomas Wowker, brilliant. You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal . \n",
      "LYNE is a seemingly simple puzzle game with basic objectives, a multitude of levels, and an euphoric atmosphere. The objectives are simple enough: connect the lines and fill up all of the spaces as you go. As the puzzles progress, different variations in the puzzles create new scenarios, and thus increase the complexity of each puzzle. By completing the puzzle, you progress onward to the next, and so on and so forth. There is no losing in LYNE. There is no time limit, either. You can take as long as you would like to solve each puzzle, and there is no penalty for simply coming back to that puzzle later. In the game, there are 26 levels, ranging from letters A to Z. Each level has sub-levels of 25. This equivalates to 650 puzzles just in the regular game mode alone. However! After completing set A and B (I believe), the player is then allowed access to daily sets. These daily puzzles consist of a version A and B, both having 25 sublevels in them. That's another 50 new puzzles per day. These puzzles range in difficulty and are completely random. With a staggering number of 700+ puzzles in just a week, there is plenty to do on LYNE. Not only is there no pressure for you to whiz by the game, but there is also a very calming and entracing soundtrack that accompanies you as you play. With each movement of the puzzle pieces, there are tones that mix together and with the soundtrack to create some really beautiful, relaxing music. Not only is this music a nice stress-reliever, but there is an actual science behind it. The ambient noises actually promote brainwave activity, thus amplifying a better mood, problem-solving, cognition, and much more. But, hey, who doesn't like to just hear something nice playing in the background? All in all, LYNE is a fantastic game that can be played by any one of any age. Not too mention it is affordable at only (about with a coupon). It's a great way to relax after a long day at work, decompress after some stressful online match, or just to simply pass the time. If you haven't played it already, I strongly recommend that you do. It is really a gem that will have you hooked! 10/10\n",

      "Adolf Hitler (German: [ˈadɔlf ˈhɪtlɐ] ( listen); 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer ('leader') of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was a central figure of the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria, then part of Austria-Hungary, and raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party, the precursor of the NSDAP, in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ('My Struggle'). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, anti-Semitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy. By 1933, the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, which led to Hitler's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany, a one-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans—actions which gave him significant popular support. Hitler sought Lebensraum ('living space') for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen ('sub-humans') and socially undesirable. Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated million civilians and prisoners of war. In addition, 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II. The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare, and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history.\n",

In 1842, Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois's mother Maria Anna. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler's brother, Johann Nepomuk In 1876, Alois was legitimated and the baptismal register changed by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as 'Georg Alois then assumed the surname 'Hitler',[5] also spelled as Hiedler, Hüttler, or Huettler. The Hitler surname is probably based on 'one who lives in a hut' (German Hütte for Nazi official Hans Frank suggested that Alois's mother had been employed as a housekeeper for a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence,[8] so historians dismiss the claim that Alois's father was Childhood and education Adolf Hitler as an infant (c. 1889–90) Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German He was one of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara Pölzl (1860–1907). Three of Hitler's siblings—Gustav, Ida, and Otto—died in When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned school) in nearby The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. The death of his younger brother Edmund, who died from measles in 1900, deeply affected Hitler. He changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and Hitler's mother, Klara Hitler's father, Alois Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf stated that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw 'what littl\n",

      "This War of Mine is one of the most emotional, grim games I've ever played. There were many moments in this game where I felt absolutley terrible for the things I had to do to survive. WARNING: this is not a happy game in any stretch of the imagination. This is a game about war, and war is hell. Sure there are a couple mildly happy moments in the game, but overhall it's very grim. This War of Mine is a game based on the Seige of Sarajevo that lasted 1,425 days and it is known to be the largest seige of a city in history. You play as a group of civilians trying to survive in a fictional beseiged city called Pogoren. You must deal with starvation, lack of medical supplies, scavangers trying to raid your supplies, and the emotional state of the survivors. One of the best things about this game is the fact that I couldn't reload a previous save to undo a horrible thing I've done, the game only auto saves after every night of scavenging and override's the previous save. This makes it more emmotionally gripping and nail-biting since it makes my decisions perminant and that it made me try even harder to not die. And it's not easy, trust me. There are multiple points in the game where I had little resources and my survivors were either starving, depressed, exausted, freezing, or all of the above. All of the abbandoned buildings were either stripped clean of supplies or didn't have the resources that the survivors needed to, well, survive. There were only 2 options: raid another shelter for supplies or die. I had to rob and/or kill (mostly) innocents for their supplies in order to survive. It's not a walk in the park either, it will be emotionally heavy for both the player (unless they're a psychopath or a sociopath) and their survivors. The one who got to raid and kill the innocents for food and supplies will suffer from severe psychological trauma. And the player will have to deal with that. And due to the trend I've seen when people who review this game tell a story from their experience from the game, I'm going to do that too. There was one day where my survivors were starving, some wounded and/or exausted. They had little resources, their options were limited. They had no choice but to attack another Shelter full of people. Marko, an expert scavenger, couldn't go because he was emmotionally broken from all the people he had to kill in order to survive. Bruno seemed to be the only one capable to go and steal from another shelter, so he was sent to steal supplies from another shelter while Pavle was to gaurd the shelter from looters during the night. When Bruno reached the place, he looked through the peephole and saw a gaurd. He waited when the gaurd wasn't looking. Bruno then equiped his knife and then stabbed the gaurd in the back. This didn't insta-kill him though, so Bruno had to stab him a second time. Bruno then looted the gaurd's corpse and found a shotgun with some ammo. This caused some noise however, and caused a woman to come down from the stairs. The woman was crying out: 'Oh god! Herald, no! No, this can't be happening!' and sat down next to the dead gaurd while sobbing. Bruno couldn't think striaght, he thought it was best to shoot the woman and put her out of her misery. The gunshot alerted two gaurds nearby, they came down and saw the two dead bodies of their comarads. They yelled out 'Murderer!' to Bruno and tried to kill him. Bruno killed the two soldiers but was severely wounded. As he looted their corpses as well as the nearby area with no gaurds, he was soaking in the fact that he just murdered innocent people for food. I felt like crap after doing that, there are many moments like these that the player will encounter during their playthrough. It's depressing but in a good way, if that makes any sense. But the game isn't perfect, the survivors will sometimes say obvious things like 'this shovel is doing while they're digging it. And the controls can be annoying at times, I've accidentally closed doors when I was trying to get through them multiple times in the game. It runs pretty smoothly on my pc, and I haven't noticed any bugs sp far. But the game's flaws hardly take away from the experience. This is by far my game of the year. I give This War of Mine a 10/10. I highly recomend it if you're sick of war games from the point of view from a soldiers perspective and glorifying violence. \n",
      "Play this game. For the love of everything you NEED this game in your life. ----SPOILERS---- My first play through was difficult both in game dynamics and mentally for me, the gamer. I lasted three hours. Then Anton, one of my team of three got sick. The second, his name was Bruce, he got stabbed in a raid. They took our medicine, food and bandages and left our friend hurt. Paulo tried to go out and get medicine and bandages, but eventually Anton succumbed to his illness. The two remaining survivors were sad and mourned his death, spending an entire day grieving. That night, Bruce left. No note, no goodbye. Paulo spent that third day sitting alone in the empty house. He wouldn't eat the food, wouldn't sleep in the bed, he just sat there. Crying about the loss of his friends, wondering if he'd ever see his little boy again. I told him, 'Just hold on one more day, maybe things will get better. Maybe tomorrow will be That night Paulo committed suicide. Then I had to sit there, staring blankly at the screen, grieving for three character's I had become so attached to as their 'final words' came across the screen. The first, Bruce, he died from his illness, there was nothing we could do, there was no medicine to be found, it was all taken in the raid. Bruce, well, he left in the middle of the night to go into the city to try and find his family but was betrayed by a trader and killed. He died alone in the city, killed like a dog. And Paulo, he hung himself in the attic because he had lost hope of ever finding his son after the war. That was three hours of game play, I felt like it was a life-time of heart ache. My next play-through I made it and we survived the war, no one died, not a single character, but it cost us. Paulo stole from the elderly couple, because we needed medicine for Anton. We left them some medicine, but we took what we needed while the elderly couple cried and hid in the bathroom, begging Paulo to leave. Anton spent the next three days distrusting Paulo, doubting him. 'Is this what we've become?' The others, they spent those days wondering if the sickly elderly woman would survive. If WE really needed the medicine more then her. We stole, we killed, we offered aid and we survived, and in the end what did we get? Meek stories, stories that felt real. There were no happy endings. Anton was ruined by the war, Paulo? He's still trying to find his son. This game is amazing, and you need it in your life.\n",
      "I survived this War of Mine on my first playthrough. Let me tell you a story. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Three survivors one day came together and as fate would have it they knew each other, Katia having interviewed Pavle before and Bruno being the host of his own cooking show. Now, no matter their past or skills, they would be reduced to nothing else but scavengers, like everyone else. War torn apart the city of Pagoren instantly, leaving everyone lost, scared and in need of shelter. The first few days, Pavle went out and gathered as much supplies as he could, enough to keep everyone fed by exploring abandonned buildings and trading with their savior Franko, always ready to barter when needed and always looking to help. Katia would negotiate best with him and get the most out of it. One day, a couple kids came to their shelter, demanding bandages for their sick mother, bandages they didn't have. They had to unwillingly turn down the poor children and concentrate on their own survival, although they would have spared the supplies they needed if they had it. Days went by and the children came back soon enough, demanding urgent need of bandages once again. They had to be turned down with a heartfelt 'sorry' for the second time. They came back much later, in dire need of help. Their mother was slowly succumbing to her injuries and needed someone to carry her to the hospital as soon as possible. Of course the group agreed and the mother was saved thanks to their kind gesture. From that day, they would help everyone who needed it and sacrifice their own survival for the needs of others, no matter the cost, their humanity wouldn't be lost. Soon after, a man named Roman who had deserted the militia came in need of shelter, they agreed to let him in and so they had another mouth to feed but another guard for the night. They went through a lot of close calls trying to secure their humanity, it would have been easy for them to just loot the house of other survivors and steal whatever they needed, but they simply wouldn't resort to such atrocities. Instead opting for the much more dangerous routes, cleaning up a warehouse of thugs and bandits, claiming it for their own and avenging the death of Olek the priest at the Church. The first skirmish would prove to be surprisingly easy for Pavle only getting wounded killing the criminals with only a knife in hand. The man felt no remorse for killing such scum of the earth and everyone in the neighborhood felt safer knowing one less group of bandit was wandering around at night. Suffering from his injuries, he would be replaced at night by Katia, having enough space in her inventory to carry the same amount as him. Time would get tougher as war raged on outside, blocking access to many routes and giving them less options to gather supplies. Investigating the Church one night and learning of the fate of priest Olek, she decided to follow Pavle's example and take care of the bandits once and for all and as luck would have it, she did it without suffering any major injuries, axe in hand. The place turned out to be a worthy risk to take and gave them enough supplies to last for a while. Luck would smile on them and with every good deed, came more surprises and hope of better days. Gathering enough supplies from the cleared warehouse and church to reinforce security, secure enough food for days and building an arsenal good enough to ensure their suvival. Books would keep them entertained and the discovery of a broken guitar brought music back into their life, the music of the radio would become redundant at times and everyone but Bruno knew how to play. They even endured the lack of cigarettes and coffee and had plenty to go around. Lady Luck was truly upon them. Then Winter even more territories to explore and once again making options thinner. One night, while out scavenging for wood and supplies at the construction site, an almost fatal encounter for Pavle arised and the army almost shot him down, wounding him severely and causing him to be bed Katia took over meanwhile and did her best to gather all the supplies they needed. Heating up the shelter became a priority and everything else would be gained through trade and barter. Thankfully for them, it was her specialty. She kept them fed, safe and secure for most of winter, that is until she was injured too while on a For a time, Roman took the job over, which wasn't easy since his bag wouldn't carry as much as both Pavle and Katia, who would remain bedridden for most of the remaining The times were tough but helping other survivors ensured them enough to survive winter and the harsh time, building two heaters to last during the cold season and harvesting as much fuel as possible at both the church and construction site. Most routes would be blocked due to snow and the options were few and far they still wouldn't resort to commiting any atrocities towards other fellow survivors. The part of town that was closed previously became once again available as snow slowly started melting and the promise of unexplored territories became accessible once again. They would loot everything the town had to offer and when the surge of crime came around, they had enough to reinforce doors, keep themselves fed, healthy and stocked on weapons and ammunition. Which would still be a challenge for them in the end, having looted most of the town and having less and less options for survival, yet they still wouldn't resort to commiting crimes or murder. Times became tougher, but they decided to built a small trap to ensure enough food to go around. Crimes became more violent throughout the city of Pagoren and the times became more than had almost no options left and they still wouldn't resort to the easier options, sacrificing their humanity wasn't an option. Much worse, ammo was running out and the insurance of protection during nightime became more and more of an urgency. Yet, they somehow managed to survive through it all, through bartering with settlements instead of stealing from them, risking their lives when needed and sparing the innocents, the declaration of ceasefire came around the corner. They had made it. All of them, through thick and thin. We had survived, This War of Mine. More importantly, we had retained our humanity. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stories like these are rare and this one will be treasured by me forever. I believe that no matter the sacrifices, helping each other out in times of need is better than being at each other's throat. War is ugly, War never changes, yet, war is sadly a necessary evil, without it, someone is bound to start one anyway and the cycle will never only it didn't exist or at least wasn't an option. This War of Mine is one of the best Anti-War game i've played in my life, portraying the true casualties of war and the people that simply tried to survive through it, fighting for simple survival, day after day. I bought the DLC and i'm glad to know that the money will go to those who need it, no matter the sum, its a worthy cause. 11/10 would survive and fight to retain my humanity once again.\n",
      "Pavle never came home from his run last night. No one said anything when he didnt return, but it was understood. Pavle was never late, he always returned just as the morning light crept over the ruins of our dear city. But not this morning, this morning he never came back, and it was understood. A deep meloncholy had washed over the survivors safe house, for with Pavle died their last chance for survival. The others were too sick, too battered and broken to move. They would die here. Death was preferable, Marko thought as he lay bleeding on the couch. The deep wound in his side had opened over night, and without bandages, he would be dead before night came again. 'I never should have gone', he thought to himself. Two nights prior Marko had made a run to a small apartment building just south of the survivors safe house. He knew an elderly couple and their son were still living there, but he figured he could be in and out with enough food to last his group a few days. But his plan was flawed. The elderly woman had seen him and called to her son, who swiftly charged at Marco with a knife. Before he could react, the son was on him, the knife sunk into his side. But Marko was strong, and his flight from that apartment proved as much. When he arrived back at their decrepid domicile, the others rushed to his aide. 'Sleep my friend, we dont need to make a run tonight'. Pavle had always been a kind man. A football player before the war, he had a rough exterior that hid the kindness in his heart. He was a good man. But it was cold, and they were hungry. So as night fell, Pavle took the handgun they had managed to steal from the military base, and made his way back to the small apartment. 'Im not going to hurt anyone', Pavle thought to himself as he crept along the ruined city streets. 'In and out, if they see me, ill threaten them with He held the gun close to himself. It was his dearest companion, his lone friend in what was to come. The apartment was quiet as he crept inside. Perhaps, he thought, the family had fled after the scare they got from Marko last night. As he made his way into the kitchen, he noticed a picture on the wall. The family that lived here; the picture showed happier times. Pavle missed his own family, who had been seperated from him in the early days of the siege. He planned to find them just as soon as he could, and he felt great pangs of regret as he wondered what they would think if they saw him now. He was lost in thought, so much so that he didnt hear the soft footsteps behind him. All he heard was a shrill scream, and the shots being fired from his own gun. The old woman lie dead before him, shot 3 times in the chest. Pavle was shocked, he hadnt meant to do it, he was startled and afraid. 'MOM!?!?' The sound of footsteps grew louder, but Pavle couldnt move. He had to explain himself, had to make things right. The son entered the kitchen, staring at his mothers corpse. Pavle tried to speak, but only dull murmers escaped him. 'Im The son shook his head, tears streaming down his face. He closed his eyes and raised the shotgun he was carrying, leveling it with Pavles heart. 'Im Pavle never came home last night. No one saw him leave, but it was understood. He had taken the survivors only gun, and returned to the small apartment to take what he could. He was gone now though, it was understood. Marko could hear Bruno weeping upstairs. He had spoken earlier of taking his own life, and Marko no longer had the energy to stop him. So he lay there bleeding; waiting for whatever came next. 'At least', he thought to himself,'I have some time to This war had ruined them, just as it had ruined their dear city. They were broken, desperate, and soon they would be dead. Why had Pavle taken the gun? What did he intend to do? He had to have known what would happen if he went back there. How did it come to this, how did they fall so far? They were good men, Pavle was a good man. Right? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Inspired by the siege of Sarajevo in the Bosnian civil war, This War of Mine is a strategy game made by 11BitGames, best known for their 'Anomaly' series. In it, players take control of a group of survivors struggling to survive in the ruins of a besieged modern day city. Over the course of the game, players are forced into the murcky gray plain of moral relativity, doing what they must to survive. I have no desire to spoil anything for you, dear reader, so ill leave it at this. Buy this game. It should be played by every person the world over, especially those who think of war as sport, far removed from the horrors it contains. It's heavy, it's dark, and it doesnt pull its punches, but it is an experience worth having for anyone who sees video games as an art form. Can you survive the siege?\n",
