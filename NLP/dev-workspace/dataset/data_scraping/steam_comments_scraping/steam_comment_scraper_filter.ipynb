The main focus is of course fighting the monsters and exploring the environments, and it is such a joy to do so. Originally I got this game at launch on Xbox as a birthday present and played through the whole thing (and then later half of the Iceborne DLC). Now that I play on PC and the game has had a recent resurgence of players, it was the perfect time to replay it and I'm glad I did. It looks amazing, especially with the official high resolution texture pack (linked below). The game offers a lot of content and lots of different weapons to try out so if you see it on sale getting it is a no-brainer for me at least.\\n\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/960781/Monster_Hunter_World__High_Resolution_Texture_Pack/\",\n",

       "   'review': 'I\\'m not sure how to even describe this game.\\n\\nI would say I\\'m primarily a PoE player. The most hours I\\'ve put into games in the last couple of years are PoE and recently BG3. \\n\\nI\\'ve got maybe 2-300 hours in BG3 and probably around 900-1k hours in PoE. I consider PoE my favorite game.\\n\\nBut then I had the pleasure of finally playing MHW. I bought it back in 2018 and maybe got on for an hour only to turn it back off. Bought the Iceborne DLC like 2 years ago only to play another hour or so and turn it off. \\n\\nSomething just clicked this time... Pro Tip for all the new people: DONT PLAY WITH THE GUARDIAN OR DEFENDER GEARS\\n\\nI would say you definitely can play with them eventually even as early as pre iceborne in the high ranks or so.\\n\\nBut for a new player you would be neutering yourself essentially by picking up these gears at the very start. \\n\\nThis game is EXTREMELY methodical in its itemization and gearing system. If you like ARPGS like Last Epoch and PoE you will enjoy the gearing very early on if you just dont play with the defender and guardian gears they give you.\\n\\nWill it take longer and require you to actually think about your gear combos/synergies? Absolutely. But by the time you get to the end game you absolutely will have learned a thing or two about the build you\\'re going for, your loadouts, the synergies that your weapon excels in.\\n\\nAnd funnily enough the absolute juggernaut of a statement that was conceived in the PoE community holds 100% true in MHW: \"The end game is where the game actually begins\" \\n\\nThe end game is where you will take on your toughest challenges and build the most ridiculous of gears.\\n\\nI just got into the end game and honestly this game has crept up into on of the greatest games I\\'ve played. While it may not strike your eye at first (the same way it didn\\'t with me initially) I highly suggest you try it.\\n\\nI\\'ve played hundreds of games. The memories I\\'ve created in this game I don\\'t think Ill ever forget. The first time running into the big red dinosaur of the forest and the absolute fear it strikes in you as you try to run away. Up until the first fight with said dinosaur. \\n\\nThen there is this land in the game that I would imagine every fan of fantasy dreams about. The Elders Recess. This land which has floors of lava and geysers which burst lava out. Big dangerous dragons and large wyverns. All of them VS just you a mere mortal. \\n\\nA true David Vs Goliath tale. I genuinely dont know how to describe this feeling. \\n\\nThat feeling of just being a mere mortal standing in front of a roaring fire breathing dragon. Sword and Shield in hand (that conveniently turns into an axe hehe) and a powerful guard ability.\\n\\nYou really feel that OOMPH that heavy heavy feeling of completely stuffing a dragons fire breath with your meaty shield. \\n\\nYou really FEEL that moment when you nail a beast 5-10 times your size right in the face. Using your most powerful charged a tack to just rock a dragons sh*t Mike tyson style.\\n\\nAn absolute masterpiece of a game. \\n\\nThere are people that hate on it because \"its too clunky\" or \"its too slow\" or \"its not monster hunter 1 and I hate it because i am obsessed with my nostalgia\"\\n\\nJust dont listen to these people. Its slow because its as if your controlling a mortal human. Thats why its even more satisfying when you mike tyson a dragon right in the ******** face',\n",

       "   'review': \"I have around 1500 hours on monster hunter series games on the PSP. Now I have 400+ on this one. This game is amazing, it suits someone like me because it doesn't need you to be perfect to win a battle, yet it's still enough of a challenge to progress through the game. Much like the PSP entries, building up your gear and actually spending time learning a monsters behaviour make it so that through a combination of gear choice and skill, you can surmount more difficult bosses, or have some fun knocking around bosses you have mastered already.\\nOne of my favourite features is answering SOS flares, to lend a hand and play with strangers. It reminds me of one of my favourite ways to play PSP monster hunter, which was the PS3 adhoc software which served as a lobby for players all over the world to play together on their PSPs,\\nOne issue is the heavy demand on rescources, especially CPU, although there is a mod that helps with this.\\nHighly recommended, 8/10\\nGame aspect rating breakdown:\\nVisual: 8/10\\nGameplay: 9/10\\nStory: 7/10\\nAudio: 9/10\",\n",

You'll get angry and frustrated on how seemingly unfair the enemies are and how absurd and clunky your attacks feel compared to other games. You'll also be overwhelmed by the amount of mechanics this game has.\\n\\nBut after a week or more, probably even months, you'll get bored and reinstall the game. You'll try another weapon and probably find a youtube video showing how to use the weapon. Then you'll fight the monster that has been giving you problems in the first place. Somehow, during the fight, it clicked. The dance you need to have to fight this monster. Ultimately, you win. The rush and excitement comes in. So you fight another monster and try to learn the dance. This keeps going on and on.\\n\\nThen, you look at your steam stats for the game and see that you have played this for nearly 500 hours. Yet, somehow, you feel there's more to do.\",\n",

If you wanna enjoy the joys of monster hunter, honestly just wait until Wilds and hope the connectivity is better, so you don't have to play 5 minutes over and over hoping the game decides it doesn't wanna DC you and basically waste hours of your time (specially if you are doing sieges). Great game, wait until the next game, see if Crapcom learns a thing or two, which they won't.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"I'd like to preface this review with the fact that I am not good at this game. I get my ass kicked by pretty much every end game monster. HOWEVER, the horrific lack of quality of life features in this game is astounding, and makes the overall experience more pain than joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can't skip these god forsaken cringe worthy cut scenes. The story in this game is not interesting, and it doesn't have to be. I just wanna kill big monsters with cool weapons.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of the base game, it forces you through nearly 10 minutes of just credits. Why?\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can't play through the story with friends. All players must have started the mission solo and discovered the monsters UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENE, then everyone has to join someones game. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe monsters hitboxes are just awful. Sometimes I get knocked over by them, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I can roll out of the way of attacks, sometimes I can't. Probably a skill issue, but it still feels clunky and lazily designed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnimations need to be 120% done in order for you to do anything else, with no animation queue system similar to Dark Souls or Elden Ring. Sometimes I click to start any animation like drinking a potion or using a whetstone, it just didn't do it and with no indication. Clunky and lazy.\\r\\n\\r\\nI played this stupid game through because it gave me the occasional dopamine hit when I smacked the monsters dumb face with a big fucking sword. As of this review I'm still not done, this game is like meth and I can't stop playing it.\",\n",

The biggest issue I have is that there is so much nothing in between those moments, which does add to the feeling of space being big but not in a way that personally makes it interesting. Exploration should be exciting and engaging, but despite being so big the world feels so small and uninteresting. The fact that you use the fast travel to get everywhere, combined with the massive amount of procedural content in between those amazing encounters just makes the game a bit of a slog. There is a good game in here, but it's buried inside of frankly baffling design choices.\",\n",

The same landmarks repeat over and over, so there is no sense of discovery. \\n\\nThe game can be saved if they put in the work and make epic DLCs that fix things. If they do, I'll come back and try again. Mods will likely help too, but until then, there are so many other games to play that are way better. I'd rather play FO4 or even Skyrim than this.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Starfield is a good-but-flawed game that has a lot of problems.\\n\\nThe Game\\'s Original Sin is being bad at leading players to where the Fun is, so I\\'m going to start by handing you that information: That fun comes from Exploration and Discovery, but it doesn\\'t come from doing Planetary Surveys.\\n\\nThe Settled Systems have a lot of fantastic and hand-crafted locations to discover. They tell you stories with the clutter that\\'s scattered around them, and the Notes left scattered on terminals. I\\'ve seen a Criminal\\'s Party Mansion full of ventilation shafts and secret passages that would fit in with a Dishonored Map, a claustrophobic abandoned bunker that feels like a horror movie, and a location with its own quest-line and the best non-Constellation companion in the game. \\n\\nNone of these locations have quests to steer you towards them. The only way you will find them is by flying around the Settled Systems and checking the Points of Interest that appear from orbit.\\n\\nThe other big source of Fun you\\'ll find will come from following Quests. Starfield has some fantastic Quests, and you\\'ll get them by talking to people. Guards in New Atlantis, Neon, and Akila City will fill your \"Activities\" Tab with leads and every one of them will take you to a Quest with memorable characters... and a lot of them are just Slice of Life material. You can stumble onto a kid who wants help posting \"Space Frog from Outer Space\" posters around a depressing outpost to lift people\\'s spirits, the aftermath of a pre-marital spat between two gentlemen that led to a fight in a restraunt, facilitating the meeting of a pair of pen-pals, and more.\\n\\nOn the more Epic and Heroic scale, you can stumble onto a collection of Independent Settlers struggling against raiders and their own (well-earned) mutual distrust and choose to help them unite and strike back to secure their place among the stars. You can find a peaceful research station under attack by raiders, which would have been overrun had it not received relief from a company of soldiers from the other side of the last war. You can find a Colony Ship from before FTL Travel hovering over a planet that someone beat them onto, and negotiate an ending to those wanderings.\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t even hit the Faction Quests. I don\\'t want to give spoilers, but all three of the major Faction Quests are well worth your time... although the Freestar Rangers quest runs a bit thin near its ending. I feel like it could use some Larian Style post-release expansion to add a few new endings.\\n\\nWith the Fun out of the way... it\\'s time to talk about the disappointments in Starfield and the places where I think Bethesda could benefit from doing some Post-Release Support.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPlanetary Surveys are good as a way to farm XP. You\\'ll level up very quickly by scanning the minerals, plants, and locations of a planet while killing animals and exploring Radiant Points of Interest. You\\'ll even get a nice chunk of change by selling completed survey data to Vladimir on the Eye... although he\\'ll probably run out of credits if you survey an entire system at once before coming in to turn in your data. However... Planetary Surveys (and planetary exploration in general) has some problems and pain points.\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the big one: The pool of Radiant Locations is too shallow to support Planetary Surveys. I don\\'t think it\\'s practical for Bethesda to create enough locations to fill the Settled Systems, but you\\'re going to see repeats if you try to survey a single Star System of moderate size. I feel that Bethesda could address this issue on the cheap by creating alternate clutter and loot layouts in the existing locations, since it makes sense for buildings like the Research Tower to be prefabricated templates that get delivered and built on planets. It would also help if they released updates with some new locations in them, to make that pool a bit deeper.\\n\\nThe second problem is that the Settled Systems feel empty in an unsatisfying way. The Major Cities of Neon, New Atlantis, Akila City, and Cydonia feel large and lived in... but they also feel like the only inhabited parts of their Factions. You will find Research Bases, Fracking Stations, and small Farmsteads in the Settled Systems while doing planetary surveys, and there\\'s some small radiant quests to help them out... but none of them really feel like communities. It makes the War between the UC and FC feel a bit pointless, since neither of them feel like they\\'ve put down roots in the space they already claim.\\n\\nI feel that the issue of the Settled Systems not feeling like they\\'re lived in could be fixed with a few  Locations with named characters... perhaps with a few associated locations guaranteed to spawn on the same tile. The game would benefit from Small Villages like Riverwood or Ivarstead in Skyrim, to make it feel like people actually live outside the major cities. There\\'s actually two locations like this in game... but two isn\\'t enough to make the Settled Systems feel like someone lives here.\\n\\nMy last point on Planetary Exploration is really more of a Quibble than a problem: The planet tiles are too big for the amount of actual stuff in them. We could really use some way to travel faster than our jetpacks and slower than our spaceships. This Engine handled Horses in Skyrim pretty well, so I feel like there\\'s a solution to be had here.\\n\\n---\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the Good about Outposts: The Outpost Building System feels like it has much less jank than the Fallout 4 Settlements did. It\\'s way easier to place buildings with the new flycam, and collision appears to be greatly improved when you\\'re trying to move decorations and furniture around. This system is reused for the Player Homes in New Atlantis, Neon, and Akila City... and a high-point of my playthrough was furnishing and decorating my homes.\\n\\nThe Crew you can get for Outposts are also a step up from Settlers, at least as long as you\\'re dealing with Named Crew. They\\'ve all got their little personalities, they\\'ve all got skills that enhance your ship or outpost when they\\'re stationed there, and you can use them as companions. That\\'s a massive improvement over fifteen dudes named Settler.\\n\\nOutposts are also a fast-track to breaking the in-game economy in half. Gathering resources from extractors, plants, and animals will let you setup production chains that will let you print money. You will be able to use that money to buy whatever Starship Configuration you want. It\\'s great fun... but it does start to feel pointless after you hit that point.\\n\\nHere\\'s where things go downhill: Outposts don\\'t feel like Home.\\n\\nThe Settlement System from Fallout 4 felt like you were building a community. You were gathering up people who\\'d given up hope in the face of the Institute, the Gunners, and the Raiders... and giving them a safe place to belong. You worked with them to gather scrap, establish agriculture, and open stores. Every Settlement became a point of light in the darkness, a safe place where you could drop your guard and resupply as you moved through the wasteland. That sense was only doubled when Survival Mode dropped, and Settlements became critical to play.\\n\\nOutposts are not like that. They run without crew, and crewing them only gives those little buffs. You can\\'t setup stores where you can buy and sell supplies, you can\\'t employ a doctor to take care of your injuries and sicknesses, and you don\\'t really get that sense of people having lives outside of working for you.\\n\\nThe other problem is that Outposts feel pointless. They\\'re a great source of components for upgrading equipment and researching new upgrades once you have them going... but they don\\'t give much ongoing benefit past that other than junk you can haul off to sell. Everything you can get from them is also available in the General Stores... meaning you can just skip the long process of setting up production chains unless you enjoy building outposts for its own sake (or to crash the economy).\\n\\nWord Limit, cont.',\n",

I hate to say it, but Starfield is an uninspired empty world that just lacks everything you'd expect from a blockbuster BGS game. (aside from the bugs and mindless AI).

       "   'review': \"This game is so dumb about how it handles mouse input. X and Y sensitivity are different by default, and there's a whole bunch of other horrible crap that can't be changed in the UI.\\n\\nThe straw that broke the camel's back for me is that ADS sensitivity when jetpacking (or otherwise airborne) is totally different from the normal ADS sensitivity. And that seems to be an engine limitation that's not trivial for modders or Beth to get around. Imo it's a serious flaw/oversight because Starfield not a pure space sim (quite obviously ha!) and therefore lives or dies on the on-planet gameplay. Starfield relies on the boostpacks as a crutch for the game's lack of surface vehicles, too.\\n\\nI had fun at times, no doubt. It's a flawed game that I could probably live with if the settings and controls were nailed (at least then, there would be a better chance that modders could fix the game). On a more general level, Starfield left me feeling like a lot of the questlines and features dropped me off at a dead end right when it was feeling like the game could open up a bit again.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"I've dumped a considerable amount of time into this game trying to find a redeeming feature but it's just ... bland. The ending is embarrassing and the storyline's premise is worn out and tired so completing it feels like more of a chore than something that was worthwhile. Things as simple as companions are just as broken as they were 15 years ago. I can't imagine anything more dull than building an outpost to manage on a featureless moon but apparently they put more time into that than figuring out how to make space combat enjoyable. And if you're wondering: yes, procedural generation does mean that you can go to an impressive number of planets and it also means that they'll hardly be varied and there are only a handful of actual points of interest that get copy-pasted everywhere, down to the data pads with flavor text left laying around. When you've discovered the same abandoned building with the same backstory for the eighth time you start to feel a little cheated.\\n\\nI wanted to enjoy this, and there's something to be said in the fact I have spent so many hours trying to, but overall it's an incredible disappointment. Maybe when it's on sale for ten bucks and the moders have done Bethesda's job for them, it'll be worth a play.\",\n",

As someone who played Oblivion, Fallout 3, Fallout NV, Skyrim, and Fallout 4 multiple times, I don't see myself finishing this game or ever really coming back to it. I was so stoked to play this, and I can't decide what I'm more disappointed about; the game itself or the fact that I now have to wait 5+ years for the next Bethesda game to *hopefully* be good. If you want a cool futuristic RPG go play Cyberpunk. If you want amazing world-building go play Baldur's Gate. If you want quality exploration go play the Witcher. But whatever you do, don't go into this game expecting to feel that same magic that the old Elder Scrolls or Fallout games had, because this game will start relatively strong and then drop off quick and leave you wanting more.\",\n",

From the release day then less than a month later I already stopped playing it, and it\\'s been about few months now I have not been playing this game. It\\'s so boring, the base building is so much worse, the skill stree is wierd, every planet had only like two cities I mean what is the point having all hundreds of planets that is empty! Oh and you can\\'t really land on every planet like Jupiter or Neptune or many others. Seriously just make one system and not spread it out so you don\\'t use it to impress people on the game show to sell saying \"1000 planets!\", Loading screen in like every minut?..... It\\'s 2023 we should be able to land and take off manually. Huge disappointment and this is a great lesson for me to never preperchance a game ever again no matter how good the game seems.

Unsatisfying story, minimal character depth, short main quest, few faction quests, lifeless side quests, loaded down with radial quests, too much focus on base building that offers no real tangible rewards, the list goes on. Todd has gotten old and action RPGs have moved on. There are better action games, better RPGs, better base builders, better survivalcrafts, everything this game aims for it does in the least enthusiastic and lackluster manner imaginable. It is unsatisfying on a deep, mechanical level, and a massive turnaround in the fashion of Cyberpunk 2.0 or gradual scaling up in the way of No Man's Sky may not be enough to save it. Bethesda is gone, go back to Oblivion or Morrowind or Fallout 3 and remember it kindly. Do not let this game be the way you remember a company that once was great.\",\n",

       "   'review': \"454.9 hrs on record- Spoiler Alert\\n\\nThis game is Boring, Its as if you wanted to sit down and ask Bethesda, What is Starfield, A game? then why do they defend this notion that real space exploration isn't about <Loots N Shoots>. If we are buying a game then it must entertain us, but I've come a crossed this push back a few times from the company as they defend their choices. Here's the experience I've had thus far almost 500 hours in. \\n\\n After completing your first walk-thru into Unity (jumping into another universe), (new game+), (NG+) there's only a few Random events that get shook lose, but all the Side Quests are the same. Main Quest will become a smash and grab fetching mini game that offers no new flavor or rogue elements that keep you engaged on finding the artifacts or temples, after which stepping thru unity rewards you with having to do it again and again. There's no new random antagonists, no surprise evil villain, no ambush or plot twist that persists through that new game (NG+) til you reach Unity again.\\n\\nAlso Side Quest weapons and armor rewards, do not level up. So if your at level 80 and NG+5 the weapon you got that was cool in the beginning that wasted ammo because it didn't hit hard enough, still will never be viable. Ammo is expensive, a hand full of bullets could be as much as the gun itself, but selling them back to the vendor will get you ripped off (big time), so don't accidentally buy the wrong bullets. [Pro Tip] collect all enemy guns and sell them to vendors to make cash, Quests in the early game don't payout much, til you level up and NG+. \\n\\nForget about base building features, because they are level locked and skill/perk locked for very late game exploration but you'll never waste the time or perks to grind those out, because they don't offer any notable combat / game play enhancements. also the funds needed to start mining just a couple of basic elements will not pay for itself or put you one step closer to financially being self-sustaining. The time wasted would net you more credits doing bounties or Side Quests for the money payouts. Unlike Fallout 4 which you could slap together water pumps and make passive income, this is not the case in Starfield.\\n\\nImagine, wanting to kill pirates and cant find any. You have to start a quest to get that ball rolling. This isn't like the Elder Scrolls where walking thru the Forrest will trigger an event. In Starfield  if you randomly land on a planet and find a generic building, that building is going to be small and not have loots worth exploring. there's only a hand full of big locations that offer meaningful combat and maybe some loots, you'll be lucky if the location respawns after a set time. \\n\\nDid you want ship combat? You'll have to jump into and out of Serpentis to trigger a hostile activity reliably enough, There's not enough player engagement to keep you surprised or interested enough to keep fast traveling to different planets or solar systems in the terms of exploring (aka roaming around) out side of questing. To sum it up, there's not enough random events or ambushes, not even a black cat crossing your path could get you into a random sticky situation either on foot or in space.\\n\\nThere was a lot of potential in this game. you get the strange feeling they fired the engagement design director. No Spacer strongholds, No Starship Graveyards, No space anomalies or very few. No Va'ruun Planets, No Va'ruun Cities, No Va'ruun Star bases, No Va'ruun destroyed / abandoned structures. It seems pretty weak to put them into a DLC after we have already NG+. \\n\\nCreators of unity and starborn are obviously going to be in DLC, so evidence of Va'ruun's existance (not just Va'ruun heretics) shouldn't be hard to find, since they are apart of the current events in Starfield, But we definitely needed something more then Generic Generated interiors (aka landing on a random planets to find small buildings with no loots). \\n\\n The Bugs in the game, just like in Fallout 4 can break the game, which sours the play-thru. [Pro tip] in Starfield, Save every 5 minutes  and have at least 10 save slots to prevent getting into a broken game scenario that prevents you from progressing in the quests or story. There's even a Bug that Prevents you from Surrendering to the law, one way or another.

They get upset for bashing the game saying consumers don't know how games are made and expect too much etc; but the fact is we pay for the final product. Imagine paying for food that ends up brunt and missing ingredients...the chef blames you because you don't like it. I pray this studio makes team changes, If elder scrolls 6 is made by the same teams it will ruin the legacy and truly be a massive disappointment for the gaming community. I feel like BGS sold out and should take notes from Larian Studios. Such a shame how Devs reacted to criticism on a subpar, empty soulless game and still refuse to acknowledge all the shortcomings, Capitalism at its finest.\\n\\nI honestly do not recommend paying for this game, just use game pass dont make the same mistake I did\",\n",

       "   'review': \"Starfield stand in a weird place for me, fallout 4 and skyrim do their role play part better but starfield also has its own reasons why to stand apart from those games. \\nStarfield has a lot of very amusing moments you get while walking around on the planets and cities. Yes, while the planets/moons feel somewhat hollow at times you should take the time to just look around take in the environment; I personally have seen a lot of very aesthetic picture worthy scenes.\\nYes Pictures not screenshots (I do both), I think the photo mode is a bit of a downgrade from the one in FO76 but it nonetheless fills that photography itch in me, god do I love myself a silly of beautiful picture. \\nThe Constellation quest line is actually really enjoyable thus far, so have been the a couple of other quest lines like the UC SysDef/ Crimson Fleet, Mantis, and Neon shenanigans quest lines. \\nAt this Current time (Early December 2023) there is work that could be done on the main Cities you visit, (Akila, New Atlantis, the such) With the places being so big in comparison with other settlements in Bethesda's previous games I think they can add more of their craftsmanship. This is not to say that they are lackluster It is to say that There is room to grow.\\nI really do wish, like many others I hear, That they expanded upon the Space Ship Design and Outpost building too, I think they both are doing what they need to do proficiently but Base Building in FO4 and FO76 shows me that they can make a system that gives us the power to make homes not just walls and a roof. Although I think their approach on Starfield is good I think they just need to give us more little decorations and semi-practical objects to freely plop down, I would look at FO76 CAMP building for what I'm referring to. The Space Ship builder has so much potential to build on, I do not really know what else they could add to make it better (Custom Modules maybe?) because I believe it does its job just fine. \\nContinuing the builders, I the PC creator is rather ingenuous for how they added in shops to change your appearance at any city.\\nThe guns while still being their own bethesda disaster of 'it just works' design is there but it is nowhere near as horrid as FO4 assault rifle. The combat is a solid notch up from their previous Fallout Games although they have not done anything rather new with it but it is solid. More laser weapons are needed and zero-G combat is really niche in this game so I'd like to see more of it. \\nStarfield is a good if not great game that manages to get some great aesthetics in with a solid story and world, the game play is a solid foundation and there is undoubtedly room for improving the game but all on its own is worth a hit. \\nIt did good on holding my attention with a lot of things to do and places to roam, shoot, and explore. At this state of the game it does really well on pleasing the Wanderer type of play style.\\n\\nAddressing the Developers- \\nThe game look wonderful and very aesthetically pleasing, it feels well designed, and playing the game feels good to play (although I do see some yank while playing every once in a while, nothing major although). I can see a lot of effort, care, and craftsmanship going into the game and I think it pays off, I do want to say that there is room for improvements. I do appreciate the game that you have all made, it is a fun game.\\nAll in all 8.25/10 game, solid base with room to grow\\n\\n\\n(It does have its Bethesda charm and I want mechs and planet side cars or smth like that please)\",\n",

In The Elder Scrolls and Fallout there was so much fascination in exploration of the worlds. The wonder and awe of finding new locations, even the nooks and crannies with nothing more in them than the landscape.\\n\\nBut Starfield makes it clear they had no idea what actually made those games special. The exploration is not fun. There's minimal reward in most questions. The best weapons are mostly randomly found. \\n\\nI've spent over 200 hours in the game already, and that's mostly because of my need for completion. Attempt to get my money's worth. Maybe the more I play, the better it'll end up getting. But it didn't.\\n\\nI'll probably play the expansion when it's released, but that's because I've already purchased it. Otherwise I wouldn't bother. I can't even trust in the modding community to help prop the game up because they seem to be abandoning it as well.\\n\\nThe magic just isn't there.\",\n",

       "   'review': 'Tried getting back into it, but I just have no desire. Most of the systems are half baked or worse than previous Bethesda games. (F4 settlement system Vs the colony system here). The game is full of loading screens, is empty, and most of the companions I have run into have little to no depth (I found one NPC on the crime world planet. She sounded like she would have a bit of a quest line to her, but it seems all she has is 1-2 unique lines she says for vising a certain planet).\\n\\nI think the biggest issue, is it is a Bethesda RPG, BUT it doesn\\'t have the TES or Fallout paint. If I throw out the term \"the blades, dark brotherhood, etc\" you know what it is. If I mention plasma rifle, you immediately imagine a green futuristic rifle that turns enemies into ash. When I mention the Vanguard, or Grendel, theres nothing iconic to it. Without the familiarity, noting has any meaning or nostalgia. Its just a bad, little though out RPG (Vanguard is a generic heroes/military, space cowboys, raiders, etc. There is no charm). This game has none of the depth/charm that TOS Oblivion or F3 had, and those games are over a decade old. Bethesda has been known as the king of Western RPG\\'s, but they arent learning and adapting, so they will eventually be left behind by those willing to push the limits and be innovative (IE Baldurs gate 3).',\n",

Exploring, looting, shooting, nice views etc.\\n\\nThe exploration part, even though there is a massive lot of possibilities and planets to explore, feel kind of empty and repetitive. Only the plot related planets and landing stations are worth going to.\\nThe guns and looting is really weak. I liked the [i]Normal, Calibrated, Refined, Advanced[\\\\i] grading system. But the plot related unique guns are just regular legendary guns (sometimes not even legendary) with no actual unique special modifiers. So there a bump down on satisfaction/excitement when getting those loots.\\n\\nPlot wise OK. I kind of felt a lack at the number of close companions. There are like these second tier companions that you find along the way, some related to the plot, others not at all. But apart from the 4 main companions (5 if we include Vasco) the interaction is very dull and almost non existing.\\n\\nI made a lot of critics, but one thing I actually liked and fouind interesting was the Unity system for gameplay. I found it unique and fun to plan about.\\n\\nIf you like this kind of game I think it is worth playing, and the developers are trying to make it better to fit some of our expectations. Just be warned about what people are saying before buying it.\",\n",

This game feels like fallout 4 and no man sky had a baby, and unlike ether of the other games, it didn't have the time to truly grow and develop like their parents did.\\n\\nTo many loading screens, story is meh. Graphics are on par with slightly better fallout 4-ish. Bugs galore like normal for bethesda. AI pretty buggy. \\nAnd really, not much to do. \\nGuns all have the sci-fi vibe to them but had a hard time liking any of them i found. \\nThe starting is also so long and drawn out, as if they WANTED it to take longer then 2 hours, past the time you could refund it by the time you found out it wasn't worth it.\\n\\nBE warned fellow bethesda game enjoyers, if you want this game, buy it on sale and then STEAM RUSH the begining to see how you like the game within 2 hours.\\n\\nP.S. - Starborn? Really bethesda, couldn't come up with anything better? Dam dragonborn in space...\",\n",
