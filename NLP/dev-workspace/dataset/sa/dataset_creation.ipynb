Would give it an 8.5 if it didn't have those annoying bugs and better AI. Recommend playing if you have friends that also enjoy 4X space games.\",\n",

       " (\"This game wins major points on story, setting, variable playstyles and grittyness.  You can play through using talk skills and hardly touch a weapon, or dive into some fairly challenging turn based combar.   Theres plenty of skills, but you must beware of spreading your points too thin.  Taking the moral high ground might get you killed, the consequences of your actions can at times be lethal.  The game's not terribly long in itself, but you wont be able to see and do everything in one playthrough. Theres no 'classes' per se, rather backgrounds and starting faction affiliations, which will to a fairly large extent influence your game. Try it with different backgrounds to see the story from a different angle. The story will also change, as your actions on behalf of your faction will change the story. Excellent replayability.  Several possible endings, and also a bit of a small 'ending recap' outlining the results of your actions (or inactions) when you move to the next main area.  The setting's fairly gritty, society and technology has taken a dozen steps back after some disaster in the past, and is slowly recovering. The setting is medieval-ish with heavy influence from ancient rome. One part of the plot is figuring out just what occured during that cataclysmic event, as records of that time is largely lost into myth.  This is a fun turn based rpg in isometric view, some may complain about the graphics, but its not the type of game that desperately needs the glossy eye-candy. It's challenging, it doesnt hold your hand, but it isnt unfair either.  I recommend this to fans of the good old isometric crpg classics. If thats you, I suggestest downloading the demo, and try that once as a talker type and once as a fighter.\",\n",

       " (\"This is not a traditional tower defense game. You don't build mazes. You don't upgrade towers. There are no units to attack. Yet, it contains a lot of the same mechanics as TD games: you build towers which attack for you; you decide whether to spend or invest resources; you strategically place towers at the right places and times. Thus, I don't feel uncomfortable categorizing this in the Tower Defense genre.  The game goes like this: you expand your base to earn resources. The larger the surface-area of your base, the more resources-per-second you earn. Meanwhile, the 'enemy' is simply a geyser of fluid  (called 'creeper')  which spreads out in all directions. If the fluid touches a tower, that tower dies. You use your towers to push back the fluid, so you can get close enough to destroy the geyser(s).  On paper, it sounds stupid. But then again, I would have said the same thing about TD games at first, and now they are my favorite genre.  In reality, this is a  fantastic  game. The game constantly introduces new gameplay-elements throughout the campaign, keeping it fresh and unrepetitive. The levels are never too easy, but also never too hard  (the main campaign, at least) . And after beating the campaign, the game opens up hundreds of levels created by the developer, his friends, beta testers, etc. giving this game immense replayability.  I've played  a lot  of TD games, and this is one of my top 3 TD games of all time  (just behind  Pathery  [www.pathery.com]  and  Entropy TD  [www.teamliquid.net] ) . If you enjoy TD games, I personally guarantee you will enjoy this game. 10/10\",\n",

       " (\"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is the updated version of the original The Binding of Isaac. It is a rogue-lite top-down shooter with procedually generated levels. If you have already played the original Binding of Isaac you might want to skip the first part of my review. In the second part I will talk about how both games compare.  The story revolves around Isaac, a boy who is living alone with his mother. When his mother becomes increasingly religious he takes away all of Isaac's toys and even locks him in his room to protect him from evil influences. In the end it comes to her delusions reaching such a high level that she imagines hearing the voice of god asking her to sacrifice her son to him. When she grabs a kitchen knife and walks up to Isaac's room the boy discovers a hidden trap door underneath his rug. He then jumps down to escape his mother. He now has to battle the nightmares in the basement and below with the only weapon he has - his tears.  The game is played in a top-down perspective. When playing with a gamepad the game is played like typical dual-stick shooter with the left stick moving Isaac and the right stick shooting projectiles - in Isaac's case his tears. Isaac can also place bombs on the ground as well as carry one activated item. Depending on the specific activated item the effect and effectiveness varies greatly.  The game is split into several chapters that each have distinct environments and enemy types. Most chapters consist of two floors. The basic goal is to find the boss room on each floor, defeat the boss and jump through the trap door to the next floor. However, there is much more to it.  There are various types of special rooms on each floor. Some of them are always present, some are optional. There are boss rooms, treasure rooms which either contain an active or a passive item, shops that sell various items and consumables, arcades that give you various opportunities of spending money for the chance to get items, challenge rooms which have one or more treasure chests in them but also spawn various waves of enemies when you open those chests, curse rooms entering or leaving which costs half a heart of your life bar but which might contain valuable items, sacrifice rooms where you can deplete your own life for the chance of a chest spawn as well as several less common special rooms like libraries that contain several book type activated items or boarded rooms that require two bomb explosions to enter but it might as well be worth it.  On every floor there is also one secret room as well as one super secret room. Those are not connected to adjacent rooms by doors so you have to guess where they might be (their placement follows a certain logic) and use a bomb on the wall where you suspect the secret room to be. Also, after every boss fight a devil or angel room might open. Those offer unique items but getting them to open strongly depends on your playstyle. Items in the angel rooms are given for free but if you want to get devil rooms items it will cost you heart containers.  At the beginning you can only play as Isaac but there are several other characters to unlock, all with their distinct bonuses and drawbacks. Other than Isaac there are Magdalene, Cain, Judas, ??? (also know as Blue Baby), Eve, Samson, Azazel, Lazarus and Eden as well as one super secret character.  There are four resources to consider when playing TBoI:R. Health, money, bombs and keys. Isaac can also carry one activated item at a time as well as an infinite number of passive items. In addition to that he can have one trinket and one activated consumable (either a pill or a tarot card) on him. Every passive item reflects on you ingame appearance and it can lead to you looking completely hilarious - or scary. There are so many items in the game that it would be impossible to talk even about a few of them here. Some items are reasonably powerful, others really strong. There are also items which are horrible on their own but can become a massive powerhouse if combined with the right items. There are a lot of item combinations in the game and part of the fun is to find out what works well together. Because of its rogue-lite nature TBoI:R relies heavily on dying and retrying. You don't directly keep something of your previous runs but you will unlock a plethora of items that you then can come across on your subsequent runs.  While the gameplay is fast, frantic and sometimes reminiscient of a bullet-hell shooter there is much strategizing behind it if you want to make the most of your run. You will frequently ask yourself 'Is it worth exploring more of this floor?', 'Is it reasonable to use a bomb here?', 'Should I really use my last key on this?' or 'Should I pick up this item hoping that I get the one that combines with it to a force to be reckoned with?'. The game is much deeper than it seems at first glance.  The story of the game is subtle rather than right in your face. There are many hints hidden all over the game. Also it is up for debate which plot points actually happen and which are made up by Isaac. There are a bunch of references to religion in the game so you might get the most out of it if you have some knowledge of the bible. But the game still works very good if you do not pay attention to the story hints.  While I consider the game design to be nearly flawless there is one gripe I have with it. At times the randomization can really screw you over. If you get unlucky you can get into situations where you cannot do anything unless you are extremely skilled. There are some mechanics to prevent this and it definitely gets better over time though. Another problem is that the HUD is often blocking view of the top left and right corner of the room you are in. This is a major problem since there can be items or enemies there. This problem can be circumvented by using windowed mode but that is not ideal either, especially because you cannot use borderless windowed mode or you will have the exact same problems as in fullscreen mode.   How does it compare to the original The Binding of Isaac?\",\n",

While not particularly horrifying, it does what few of the newer entries have managed to do by maintaining a creepy atmosphere throughout an engaging story. However, its biggest feat is that it feels like it's written by people who actually like Resident Evil. Seriously, the writing makes impressive use of all aspects of RE lore, characters, and inside jokes, even to this long-time fan of the series. Between the satisfying four-episode campaign, an intricate raid mode, and a seemingly endless supply of challenge modes and collectibles, there's more than enough content packed into such a small price tag. To say it's worth it would be an understatement.\",\n",

Second: Being docked on a ship and ordering the captain to take me where I want to go, all while watching some of the best space scenery pass by while standing in the hangar of said ship. Now, I've played a lot of games with space and space travel being the premise and never have I seen this kind of vision or ambition in a game. Of course, perhaps Egosoft was too ambitious. A lot of the systems that are implemented are prone to failure, some of them gamebreaking. But I've played X2: Beyond and X3:TC and AP, I can say that this company never stops working on their games, the FANS never stop working on their games. Most people who have played this game get down on it for being buggy. Try to picture it this way, all of you have played betas, bought into kickstarter games, etc. and these games will have their problems, I've got friends who have plunked down 200 clams on Star Citizen to simply get a hangar and explore their ship. My point being, don't jump on the bandwagon of bashing Egosoft simply because their game came out about the same time the Steam Review system did. Think about it for a minute. Any basement-virgin-internet-punk can bash a game. And destroy the english language in the process, but my respect goes to the articulate. Thanks to Steam, we can play this game any time after purchase, and thanks to Egosoft, this game will be perfect given enough time, I'm excited to see where it's at a year from now.\",\n",

Nothing special to it  The gameplay is where this game shines, you have a car with a massive list of parts that you can upgrade you have three main aspects to it: Speed, handling and strength. You can either have a car that is good at all of them or a car that is great at two and weak at the other. the customization is also complex and fun, it's not just you trying to max out every category, you also have to keep in mind the down side to every upgrade.  Upgrading Max himself is also just as fun. Learning new combat moves never felt like I'm wasting scrap (the currency in the game). Each move felt unique and useful from reversals to wall slamming to limb breaking. The game is also VERY violent and gory which makes it even better for me. You'll face different types of enemies that will require you to use most of you moves along the game.  The open worlds of this game is one of the best I've ever seen in any video game. All the roads connect to each other and it's extremely nonrestrictive which is a huge plus. Each area has a big balloon where you can spot landmarks and 'Threats' that you need to lower in order to unlock new upgrades for you and your car  The graphics in this are superb, especially when it comes to lights, shadows, tire and footstep trails. The game looks pretty colorful and well done. Can't ask for much more than this  The sound isn't up to the game's standard.

Where TheHunter had you collecting stuff before you could really hunt anything, in this game, they drop you off on an island ready to go. There is a money system, 'gems', that you use to buy upgrades in the game. It does get a bit grindy when you are mostly just killing things to get enough gems to progress, but this is to be expected. Who wants to have all the best stuff right out of the gate? So you start off hunting with no 'toys' and a standard gun. At some point you'll be able to buy a crossbow, which is better at taking down wampuses but has a lot of drop after you fire it. So you have to look at your distance to figure out where to shoot. Not too much after that I was able to buy the sniper rifle, which is pretty much where you aim you hit.  There are only a handful of dinosaurs, but the ones they picked are very well done. The one people might miss would be a Velociraptor, although there is a medium sized carnivore that chases you around to make up for that.  The environments are really well done. There are some islands in fog where you can't see where the dinos are very well, and this really adds to the tension. The final island is a big, rocky place where you can see the dinosaurs from far away and is maybe a bit too easy, but at this point you'll mostly be cleaning up the achievements you haven't got, so I thought that was OK. Oh, and there's also 'mutant' dinosaurs, which are rare and give you another thing to go after. They are supposed to be extra dangerous I guess, but I never noticed much difference.  I think I got this in a bundle. I would say it's worth the $15 regular price though. As you can see, I've got over 13 hours on it to get all the achievements and pretty much do everything in the game once.  There may not be a whole lot to it, but if you're after a dinosaur hunting game, this does that really well and is fun, and that's what matters!

Playing a World War One game is something you've never experienced, they did an absolutely brilliant job of making it as real as possible without it being a difficult simulator like the ARMA franchise.

       " (\"So I just completed 100% of the achievements (Pre-Valhalla Edition) for Jotun and figured it was time that I write a review for this game that I love so much. From the outside, Jotun looks like an adventure/exploration game with little combat during levels and tricky epic boss fights. While this is true; for me, the meat of this game comes in boss mastery and completely centered around combat.   Jotun starts with Thora (the hero) dying without a chance to enter Valhalla due to an inglorious death. Odin, the Allfather grants you a chance to enter Valhalla through great deeds by collecting runes and defeating the Jotun (giant elemental beings tied to Norse mythology). To battle a Jotun, you must complete two levels through exploration and some puzzle solving (unfortunately little combat). These levels are associated with the elements of the corresponding Jotun and vary in terms of what is needed to complete them. Each level will have a rune, an apple (increases max health) a Godshrine (gives you a God Power or additional uses of said God Power) and a few vistas or other points of interest where the camera zooms out giving some beautiful shots. Once the runes have been found, it is time to face the Jotun.  These Jotun bosses are giant elemental beings that will test your resolve, quickness and combat strategy. Fighting these beasts for the first time can feel like an impossible task and defeating them feels like a massive accomplishment. In fact, when beating these bosses for the first time you wonder how any of the achievements for them are even possible. This is where this game goes from good to great!! Each Jotun has 5 achievements associated with them. 1-Initial defeat, 2-Shun the Gods (use no God Powers), 3-Perfect (take no damage), 4-Time trial, 5-Special conditions (ie. don't attack in melee, defeat at under 10% health etc.) Learning all the bosses patterns/quirks and figuring out strategies to complete these tasks can be daunting, but because of reliable combat mechanics and tight controls is very rewarding. Combat is simple with a regular attack that can be used twice for a slightly faster combo, or heavy attack which is a painfully slow wind-up followed by a massive blow. Throw in a dodge-roll and six God Powers (speed-up, heal, shield etc.) and that's it. What makes the combat so great is that you know exaclty what you can get (and are going to get) out of your character. Learning how to use this to maximum advantage is all you have, and what makes this game SO DAMN FUN!!  Now with the Valhalla Edition, all of the Jotun are buffed to the max (more HP, do more damage, more powerful abilities etc.) I haven't played much of this mode but it seems insane, really looking forward to the challenge!!  To sum up, if you're looking for a good action/adventure with outstanding visuals, good music/atmosphere and decent combat... you'll probably find it here. If you're looking for the above with testing combat achievements and you enjoy boss-mastery type games you might just fall in love with this gem like I have.

For instance, near the beginning of the game there are two puzzles that revolve around teeth going on at the same time, so which solution fit where was a bit confusing.

Meaning you can lose an hour or more of progress easily...and routinely. Add to this the autosave feature which saves AFTER a turn has completed. It does no good whatsoever.   Lost a healer I had since the beginning of the game due to a damage over time ticking for 1/3 his health. Try to load the autosave, and it just loads the same scene over and over where he is dead. You can always opt to reload a save from town and lose all the time and anything you found in the dungeon. Then again you could opt to just not waste your money on a game with intentionally abnoxious game mechanics included.  If you are looking for a nice RPG where you can develop a party of adventurers look ELSEWHERE. Besides the aforementioned problems the game is shallow at its core. And the panic feature is nothing but a doom counter, so if you hate doom counters you will hate this game.  I find nothing redeeming about this game. The only thing I wanted from it was character development and RPG like features. It not only fails to deliver, it intentionally makes it frustrating to play in this manner. I wholeheartedly recommend you DO NOT buy this game.  If I could get refund( I am hoping) I would, but at the very least I can hopefully stop at least a few others from wasting their money on this garbage. I wish steam would vet these games more. The glaring thing that really pisses me off is that the developers are selling it as a RPG like game with character development for the money, but actually created a game that makes it possible to lose all your characters in often unfair, unbalanced situations....or of course you can reload a save from town which might be an hour or more of progress lost.  Awful the developers ought to be ashamed.\",\n",

       " (\"Off the bat, here's my rating 9.5/10 (Not a full 10, because sometimes it gets annoying when playing due to the 'fast travel' and crappy combat mechanics in my opinion. They're turn based which isn't BAD, but if you're fighting a lot of them and they do critical hits to you, say goodbye.)   Reading other reviews, I do have to say that I was a bit weary of buying the original Fallouts. (I love this series to death with Fallout:NV being my favorite) It is, as I could compare it too, and point and click type of style; which is fine to me, but being used to VATS and other mechanics that were used in the later games threw me off. However, this is understandable since it was created by an entirely different company. So coming from a person who's put hours and hours into FO:3 and FO:NV, if you're interested in starting where it all began, understand that it won't be the exact same. Does that mean it will suck? No, unless you hate how it's setup. I do want to point out that it does take a while to comprehend the game and keeping a walktrough open may just save your life a little. NOW what is this game about? Well for starters, it's time based. Your Vault's water chip broke so the Overseer sends you out into the Wastes to find a new one. Along the way you find towns and a wide range of people who will help you along the way to finding one. Out in the Wastes there are good people and bad people, and a large population of mutated things that will kill if given the chance. I won't go more into it as I don't want to spoil it for y'all, but there is a a lot of things you can do it this game which is pretty rad. (Also if you're a huge fan like me, you'll notice the music is the same as FO:NV in some places) I haven't beaten the game yet, I actually have to restart because I don't have enough days left to support the Vault...A tip for y'all, When you 'Fast Travel' Watch your days! They add up the farther you go! So yeah, play the game if you're a fan. If you aren't, and more used to newer games, I'd save it unless you know what you're getting into.  \",\n",

       " (\"Ok, it says I have only played like 4 hours, but I have played and beaten the game outside of steam. So, here is my review. This is basically a game that can be enjoyed by everyone. Besides maybe some squeamish folks, as blood, gore, and violence are VERY present throughout the whole game, albeit pixelated. Also, I would not recommend this game for anyone who gives up/rage quits easily. As you will die A LOT and have to restart a specific level. But of course this makes beating the level or bashing enemies' brains incredibly satisfying. This game is VERY fast paced, so you have to be able to either think quickly, or design a fail-proof plan of going through. Either way, you will need to move your mouse fast, and your character faster, dodging bullets or coming around a corner to home-run swing a dudes face with your baseball bat. The psychedelic soundtrack is badass, and compliments the whole 'trippy' neon art style. There is a chance you may start to feel nauseous, as the level moves and rotates a small amount during gameplay. I personally never felt anything like that, but I can understand how you could. This is a game where you get visibly better the more you play. Its a cool experience to compare your starting skill level, to the end of the game, where you are able to open a door, immobilizing someone in the process, shooting a man at the other side of the hallway, throwing the gun at another to immobilize him, then finishing off both with vicious brutality. All in one fluid motion. The story itself is interesting, but honestly, I didn't pay much attention to it during my first playthrough. In terms of flaws, I have heard that it is buggy, but I haven't found anything game-affecting. And thats about it. Seriously. I cannot think of anything that I would want different. All in all, I would highly recommend this game who is looking for a highly challenging, neon-soaked bloodbath with great music to compliment it. Bashing an enemies head against the ground while watching your points rack up never gets old.\",\n",

Glitches still exist, some enemies take a few too many hits to beat, and maybe it still is a bit grindy, but it's fair now (framerate, for me, is no longer an issue, by the way). Almost everything has been reworked and tweaked. Some skills and tricks that seemed impossible to me years ago I pull off all the time now. I've acheived things in this game, I've worked and have been rewarded, and it makes me want to come back and do it again and see what else I can do.

       " (\"I wasn't sure what to expect with dying light, being a massive fan of the assassin's creed series and not much of a zombie game genre enthusiast I wondered just how good a first person parkour game feat. zombies could be.   Turns out, it can be one of the best games i've ever played.   Right from the off I was absorbed by a number of things - namely the superbly crafted atmosphere assisted in part by a haunting and fitting soundtrack. The graphics were stunning from start to finish, the sound effects were absolutely terrifying at times and whilst the story didn't grab me initially, having now finished the main game and expansion I can reflect on an interesting and at times gripping narative with some fine character development, not just of the protagonist (particularly in the expansion).   I played the game entirely single player, feeling that doing so would help with my feeling of immersion and a sense of isolation. My decision was vindicated as I felt a level of heightened involvement that scarce few games have ever delivered, something which owed a lot to the expertly crafted setting of both the city and countryside areas. Running around in the night cycles always gave a rush of adrenaline and no matter how many volatiles I ran in to they never failed to scare the hell out of me.   The weapons, crafting and combat were also all done superbly well. Combat never felt dull or repetitive, and decapitating a zombie was satisfying every damn time. The huge range of available weapons and the various means of improving them meant that looking for ever more powerful weapons was a fun sidenote. I also liked the fact that weapons could only be repaired so many times, meaning that I was forced to think carefully about backup weapons or prioritising finding a new weapon.   Naturally no game is without its drawbacks, and my major gripes were as follows:  - the last encounter in the main game was a bland quicktime event which totally went against the fun combat that had been such a big part of the game up to that point (this was rectified by the far more enjoayble final fight in the following DLC)  - in both the main game and the expansion there was a lot of yo-yo-ing around the map, which whilst fun at first thanks to the excellent parkour and driving in the following, did get tedious after a while  - some of the climbing mechanics were a bit annoying at times, such as when climbing a mast or scaffold tower and being unable to move freely around the diagonal bars or swap between inside and outside the tower frame. Hardly a major flaw!  Other positive points:  - I went through the game without using half of the things on offer in the various talent trees or weapons, suggesting that there was plentiful variety for players with different approaches to combat and lots of different things to try if you are that way inclined.  - A consistently good level of challenge was maintained without the game becoming too difficult.  - Whilst the lure of multiplayer was never huge for me, it is good to know that it is there and from other reviews I have read it is another good aspect of the game.  - The grappling hook, whilst laughably unreaslistc was a lot of fun and served to increase the pace of the already fluid and dynamic freerunning.  - There was a good range of available side missions with a decent variety of objectives and means of completion  I have read other reviews indicating that the end of the expansion was poorly done or unsatisying, but I didn't find this to be the case at all. I chose the non-sacrifice end and was not dissapointed by the boss fight or the ultimate outcome. Having read the outcome of the other decision I think that both are a decent end to a very enjoyable expansion.   TLDR:   9/10, would decapitate zombies again.\",\n",

They even included an easter egg that the end boss through a black hole is called Master of Orion 2.  The good: Great ship design, easy to manage solar systems, you can always see using F2 how each planet is doing. Ship battles look amazing!! Love the graphics and watching as your cannons smash the enemy ships is great. Easy to play hard to master type of game play.  The Bad: AI is tough, a little to tough on normal. It seems that you cannot be friends with anyone, they all will declare war with you eventually. The ship movements is buggy in tactic battles. Do not use auto battles unless you are fighting only one ship. Gauss Cannon is too strong. Balance issues all over the place. Human Titan ships are way small compared to the bug/hive race. Having more room to put big guns on your ships is a big advantage.  There are a ton of bugs still in this build. In the tacticle view you will ships dance all over the screen. The defensive buildings for tacticle ground combat do not work at this time. My ground forces end up starting the fight with 0 health but as long as they do not get hit they do not die...  I would say if the bugs will annoy you too much wait, but if you can look past them the game is great!! \",\n",

This game is beautiful and runs very well. (+) Gameplay has been streamlined. Trade is no longer a mess and is sent between sectors, rather than islands. (+) Map design is very good. Sector projects add a much needed end goal. (+) Building radii have been done away with in favor of a much more interesting supply system. (+) The UI has been given a much needed facelift. It provides much more meaningful information and ensures a much better experience in handling production and supply chain management. (+) Being able to move and adjust buildings AFTER you've placed them is a huge improvement. (+) Sound design and soundtrack are both improved.  NEGATIVE: (-) Combat is restrictive and relegated to zones that exist outside of your economic empire. You will never feel threatened. (-) The variety of buildings you can construct in each environment is fairly limited. (-) The lack of a map generator, skirmish mode, and competitive AI rips a lot of replay value from the game. (DLC?) (-) The lack of disasters and ecological consequences strips a large element of surprise/challenge from the game.  CONCLUSION: 8.5/10 All things considered, this is a very strong entry into a long line of complex city-building games. Many veteran players may dislike the streamlining of the gameplay and feel like a lot of the challenges have been stripped out, but they will find different challenges coming into play in the late game. If you liked Anno games beforehand, but felt the complexity was a bit burdensome, you will love Anno 2205. Likewise, if this is your first entry into the series or even city-building games in general, you will find a lot to appreciate.\",\n",

       " (\"Super Crate Box is a 2D run and gun arcade platformer. If that is tough to digest, the game is played in a single screen. The point is to get crates. Once you get a crate, a new one spawns. Inside each crate is a random weapon that you've unlocked. Why do you get crates? To unlock new weapons, characters and levels to play on. There are only three levels, but I'm happy with that. The first level feels so good to play on that you almost don't need the other two.  Enemies drop from a hole in the ceiling of the level. Standard left and right moving enemies, when they get to the edge they fall off to the next one. There are bigger versions of the standard enemies that take twice as much damage. Finally, there are hovering skull enemies that bounce around. Its a nice simple variety that still adds challenge. Since the enemies work their way to the bottom, there is a fire pit. If the enemies reach the fire pits, they come back red, angry and twice the speed! In a way it feels like the original Mario Bros. arcade game. One screen levels, and enemies that get angry, doubling their speed.  The major difference is the guns. Each gun has unlimited ammo and feels fun to use, with their own pro and con. Dual pistols will shoot left and right simultaneously, but do 1 bit of damage. The revolver shoots one bullet at a time, but does double damage. The machine gun shoots straight forward very quickly, but pushes you back. The flamethrower will effectively light platforms and enemies on fire, but if you stand in the fire, you can't jump. The katana has short range, but does a lot of damage and sends big enemies the other way. The shotgun has short range, but sends out a big blast of randomized bullets. The bazooka fires rockets that are slow to reload, but they do a lot of damage in a radius. Grenade launchers do the same thing, but they reload faster and arc when you shoot them. Mines take a while to arm themselves and can only drop straight down, but do the same big radius damage as rockets and grenades. Lasers take a long time to fire once you pull the trigger, but go through everything. The disc gun bounces off the first wall it hits and goes through enemies, but it will also kill you.  You can only carry one weapon, so when you get a crate, its a different weapon. Some weapons are better than others, so there is a dynamic of not getting a crate to use a good weapon to kill a screen full of enemies vs just getting the next crate.  You will unlock new characters, but they all play the same. They just different. The game will give you a random character when you play. One hit will kill you, but that's the balance. Guns vs swarms of enemies. With every death, the game will tell you what you've unlocked, how many more crates you need and send you right back in as if nothing happened. The whole thing takes a second or less. If the game gets too easy for you on normal mode, there is a hard mode.  The game keeps track of your high score in crates, but there are no points awarded. Hopefully there will be a more complete sequel with support for co-op and points, but that is in no way a complaint for this great FREE arcade game. In all, its a fun free game. If it came out in the 80s, Super Crate Box would have made millions of dollars in quarters. Not just that, but this free little game is enough to make me want to play other games from the developer.\",\n",

       " (\"This is probably one of the goriest games i've played ina while but i mean that in a good way. You play Lo Wang who is sent byhis boss to retrieve a sword called the Nobitsura Kage but it turns out it's not a normal sword and then Wang finds himself fighting demons who are invading the world. I really enjoyed this game at first. It gives you a samurai sword and some guns and lets you hack,slash and shoot up enemies in a very gory fashion and has you do so in a funny over-the-top kind of way. However once that initial enjoyment wore off the game started to feel a bit dragged out and the combat became repetetive.  To be fair they did try to make the combat a bit varied with the ability to unlock different attacks and powers as well as a variety of weapons but the game just boils down to you entering an area, the game throws a load of enemies at you, you kill them and travel through the level a bit more and then repeat. This really makes playing the game a chore after a while as it just feels like your doing the same thing over and over again. I did like the frantic pace off the combat though and it does provide a good challenge as well as being visually gory which people may like or not.  The games levels look pretty good in general although there is a bit of lazy level design at times with certain areas looking like they have been copy and pasted in from earlier. In the beginning there doesn't seem to be much of a story and as the game continues it's a bit hard to follow but it does pick up going into the final third of the game and ends quite well.   The Good: - Enjoyable combat with the ability to upgrade and unlock weapons and powers and rewarding damage to enemies like cutting off heads and limbs. - I liked the humour in this game and the back and forths between Wang and his accomplice Hoji are enjoyable. - Visually the game looks pretty good with some of the earlier levels in particular looking quite nice.  The Bad: - Combat sections get repetetive after a while and at times it just feels like a chore when the game is constantly throwing wave after wave of enemies after you. - The game feels a bit dragged out with the middle part of the game feeling unneccesarily long. - I found the hit detection was a bit poor at times which can be irritating at times.  Summary  This is a pretty decent game although it has it's flaws. It's a 6.5/10 from me.\",\n",

The combat and platforming are quick and easy to learn but show a level of depth some games can only dream of achieving.

That wouldn't have been a deal breaker, but it means that navigating to the next part of the game becomes virtually impossible. We simply could not find our way no matter how much we looked around.  Enola seemed okay at first, with a decent atmosphere and a curious story. But aside from the inability to see, the puzzles Enola offers up are extremely simple, rendering that part of the game a bit boring.

The idea to combine psychological horror, the struggle of an artist with the disturbed mind of an alcoholic did sound intriguing.  The game is an easy going walking simulator with just a couple of puzzles. Your overall action is to walk and open doors and drawers. Though at the beginning the game claims 'with your action you tell the story', this is way too much promise! The game has three endings, but it's not really visible how you change them at all. While playing you just realize you can chose between paths sometimes. After reading a bit in the walkthrough, there seem to be crucial actions that you have do to trigger a certain ending. None of them were obvious to me. In the end, I'm fine with my outcome (the neutral ending), but I wouldn't try another run, because I don't want to use a walkthrough or fail with guessing.  What Layers of Fear does in an amazing way is visual storytelling! First I thought it's a mere 'Gone Home' clone, but the house soon turns out to be non-linear and shaping in the most amazing ways. The house becomes you, your character's psychological state of mind. The longer you play, the crazier the rooms get and really display the horror of the protagonist.  Something the story completely fails to do! I really missed a deeper relationship between the artist and his wife. The so-called psychology in this horror was mostly weeping wife and cliched crying baby in the background. 'Wife becomes annoying for the artist, because she got ugly.' Two books about marriage problems in the game and a lot of emptied wine bottles are not enough, at least for my taste and what could have been possible with all the assets. Just a couple more letters or a diary would have been amazing...With this subject and two story writers I really hoped for more than the typical annoyed husband that gets vicious over time.   What I also deeply missed in this horror game—the actual horror. Apart from a couple of jump scares you never feel thrilled at all. You simply can't die! Horror to me comes a) with fear of the unknown (totally visible puppets and characters won't do) and the possibility to die, because you are powerless. Thanks to the level design, lighting, sound and FX this game is so well crafted and thick with atmosphere, that it's a joy to just walk through the corridors excited what they have in mind after the next door.

Not that it was that much different on consoles, but don't be expecting constant 60 fps unless you have a more high end card.  On the plus side though the game implements the Euphoria physics engine perfectly. The motion capture and sheer detail put into ever animation in the game is really impressive. On the other side though it's probably the most glitched up halarious and down right broken physics engines out there.  And I guess that's this game in a nutshell. The story is extremely detailed, gritty, and emotional, following Niko Bellic down his story with the new country. But on the other hand you just ran over a fat lady with your motor bike, with a mod that puts you in a chicken suite, and you do the chicken dance on her corpse. While that is happening the police go and bow down before you with another mod that makes police worship you instead of kill you...  Aaaand yeah this game is scewed up.  FYI: I have no clue if these mods exist but they're bound to be on the internet somewhere. Also if you're planning to get this keep in mind Gta 5 comes to PC this fall so remember that before your purchase.

       " (\"short version: graphics and gameplay hold up pretty well. atmospheric, creepy..  long version: if you've never played it, it holds up well. the graphics are basically doom 3, maybe a little better. the level design is weird, so expect to get lost a couple of times. you'll spend most your time in industrial facilities (like half life), and offices.   they're generous with the 'bullet time', so even if you use it up, you'll find more to spare. you can increase your amount of bullet time by finding hidden needle thingies throughout the levels. if you jump and melee, you'll do a bicycle kick. this takes dudes out instantly, and feels kinda cool. you can also do a slide kick, but i forgot i had it. when i re-discovered it, i didn't use it much. mostly i used melee to creatively break glass. they give you remote-controlled grenades, and proximity mines, in addition to regular grenades. these are pretty situational, so i ended up throwing out, for example, a proximity mine like a regular grenade because my inventory was full. you don't fully regenerate health, but if you're below 25, it'll recharge. it recharges faster if you don't move. i appreciate that kind of nuance. i mostly used the shotgun. the assault rifle and submachine gun go all over the place, and the tracers look out of synch with the sound. you can kinda aim down the sight, but it's actually just a slight zoom-in. it's still tactically viable. in the end, i stuck with the shotgun as my primary weapon, particle beam as my secondary, and rocket launcher or repeater (which is...a grenade launcher?).   about half way through the story grabbed my interest. i even went out of my way to hear 'bonus dialogue' you find on laptops. it ends on a cliffhanger, though. i like the atmosphere, but some of the ambient music is on a short loop, which hurts it for me. it's good at creating tension, and most of the jump scares worked, but it's nothing like amnesia. i thought doom 3 was a little scarier. maybe.   will also mention the AI doesn't seem extremely smart, but i did find myself playing with it often. it's better than mindless legions of soldiers running at you with assault rifles. more than better. they'll try to flush you out with grenades, which leads to you having no other option than running straight in and gunning/meleeing everyone down. that's how i approached it. you always know what they're doing, and you can plan accordingly. if they didn't say anything, maybe...well, it's still fun.  leaning is outdated, and it's awkard to hold down Q or E while moving. i guess you're not supposed to. i ended up binding them to 2 of my 6 side mouse buttons, and it worked well for me. you'll probably want to spend some time making comfortable keybindings before you get too far into it.\",\n",

And if you like puzzle game, don't worry, PlanetSide2 has plenty for you to figure out, especially the first few weeks. The game has a steep learning curves with so many things you could do (air combats, vehicular combat, infantry, max...), and countless ways to die or kill. Cons: You will need decent gaming rig to even play this game on medium as the big fights can drop your frame rate significantly. Unlocking gears takes a bit long. After a year of playing, I don't think I even have 25% of the gears unlocked. Of course, that is also because there are a lot of stuff to unlock. It's free to play so I can't complain much.

The story is interesting and occasional tense, dialog has excellent voice-acting, and the attention to detail is admirable. I get the feeling the author actually had a firewatch job in the 80s in order to know this much about it. I can tell a lot of heart went into this game.  You really start to feel for the main character as he traverses through what was supposed to be a restful summer job. The narration at the beginning sets up that his wife got early Alzheimer's and no longer recognized him. While she is cared for in another country by her family, he takes a job as a fire lookout in a national park. His only contact is his supervisor in another tower that he communicates with only through a walkie-talkie. As he encounters things like campers using fireworks or mysterious fenced-in areas, he radios it in to his supervisor. She gives him advice and they discuss the best course of action. In the downtime, they chat about their lives and find out more about each other. While you face occasional danger to due things like sliding rocks, mysterious interlopers, and of course, fire, there is hardly any violence.  While I enoyed playing it, I have some misgivings about it. The profanity is a little thick sometimes--both the main character and his supervisor use a lot of colorful language, including a lot of f-bombs. An option to bleep the strong language would have been appreciated. Next the interface where you choose your response to your supervisor from a menu of choices only stays up for a few seconds. If you are not fast enough with your mouse or keyboard, the game progresses as if you chose to say nothing. This brings me to my last point--you only have an illusion of being able to fail. The game won't really let you die or fail at something no matter how it might appear. The illusion is a good one, done with the smoke and mirrors of a few well-programmed contingent lines of dialog to get you back on track, but an illusion nonethelesss.   Overall, the strengths of this game far outweighed the weaknesses and it is well worth it picking this up and spending about 4-8 hours playing it, especially if on sale.   \",\n",

But the good parts of the game puts the problem below. The game may seem repetive to some with the long campaign. The options to play both armies from the first 8-Bit Arimes and Hordes for skirmishes and online gives a great experince.

The combat is smooth and easy to learn even though there are multiple things that influence combat. The combat is also very similar to the Neptunia V or the Neptunia Rebirth series. The game is not exactly short either my first play through of the game took 33 hours. The game has 3 different endings which does also increase the replayability of the game.  Unlike in many RPG's you do not change your weapon instead as you play the game you aquire something called weapon boost points, these points allow you to customize your weapons stats increasing it's damage, magic attack, increase physical and magical defense how far your attack range is and couple other things. With weapon boost points you are also able to get new skills, magic, abilites, and a few other things.   Similar to the Neptunia Rebirth series there is a world shaping option as well which allows you to change mobs or items in dungeons however unlike the Neptunia series there is normally a negative that goes with the positive for example you will gain 30% more exp but you will have 10% less defense.  The characters in the game are all likeable and have personality and over the course of the game you actually see their personalites change which is nice to see. The english voices are all well done and none seem out of place for the character.  The bad in my opinion  If just following the storyline the game is rather easy.  The game has 3 different endings which is good however there really is no clear indication ever of what path you are on basically if you want the other two endings you will either have to go through it with trial and error or look up a guide.   Other than that there really is no negative I can think of.

There is a massive player world with dozens and dozens of side quests, but the immersion factor is sorely missing. I ended up with the same problem I had when I played most of the Elder Scrolls series. My character became too powerful from pursuing all of the side quests, and nothing in the game was a challenge anymore. Add to that the fact that I reached a roadblock in the main quest which involved a dungeon that took more than five minutes to walk back through because of a missing item that I could not find, and there was not enough enjoyment here to keep me happy. The game seems more like work than play. It was very unenjoyable.   I put in over 40 hours, and I am done. I think my save is bugged, and I'm not willing to start over. Suffice it to say that I won't be completing this one. I can't recommend it for the same reasons that I can't recommend any of the Elder Scrolls games. It's too ambitious with no grounding.

I can't recommend this game enough- I've already bought a few gift copies for friends to experience it and they all share the same love for it that I do.   If the experience isn't enough, let's talk about the gameplay some! Undertale is, at its heart, an RPG. But unlike most turn-based battle games, the fights you fight are full of character &amp; the boss fights are memorable for reasons besides 'oh that boss was so hard/had TONS of health'! The battle system will have you smiling instead of groaning, there's no grinding involved, and the best parts of the game are actually found by not killing anybody.  The game is sweet as can be, and is full of wonderful messages, but also knows it can be scary and sad when it needs to be. You will feel emotions, and you will love every moment. There's also quite a few branching paths, and a LOT changes depending on how you play.  Do yourself a favor and buy Undertale. It's a special treat that shows how much video games can matter.  Also do your best to get the 'true' ending. Trust me, it's worth it.\",\n",

       " (\"You've read all the negative reviews. It's true that performance was sketchy at first, framerates all over the place and lots of stuttering. The patch seemed to really improve on that, at least for me. I'd just like to suggest that you put the reviews into perspective. Right now there are 6550 negative reviews out of several hundred thousand players. Last I checked there were over 200,000 people playing the game at the moment - not total purchases, concurrent players at the time I checked. So that means that about 3% of them gave a negative review, which in turn means far less than 3% of total owners have given a negative review. In other words, over 97% of owners have NOT given a negative review. So please bear that in mind when thinking 'oh no, everyone who has this game is giving it bad reviews'.  Anyway, just to throw in a little bit of an actual review, this game really should not be compared to Elite or Star Citizen. It was never meant to be like that but it's undeniable that some people wanted it to be 'Elite for PS4'. The game design actually seems to lean more towards terrestrial play than space play. Maybe I'm biased because I just spent about an hour lost in a cave that was full of gold. I think it's better to think of it as being an exploration game that just happens to have interplanetary travel as opposed to a kind of space sim. That said, you could play purely in space if you so desired.  It's an explore 'em up with a retro sci-fi theme and light survival elements. There's variety here; I've mentioned my sperlunking but I also broke into someone's base and stole tech from them, traded with aliens, hacked into some kind of data relay and made it show me where alien artefacts are so I could learn more of their language, fed a space kangaroo some lumps of carbon (I don't know what that does) and have just docked at my first space station and am about to explore it. I feel like I'm really exploring space in my crappy little ship and am looking forward to improving it along with my gadgetry. I bought this game to get immersed in exploring an effectively infinite galaxy. Right now that's certainly what I'm doing and that's why I recommend this game.\",\n",

       " (\" Probably one of the best 5 player co-op games I've ever played! Much like Evolve, four survivors try to escape from one player-controlled monster. Scavenging creepy maps in search for randomly spawned items such as batteries, keys, numerical codes (for opening safes), crowbars/hammers, etc.  As survivors, working together is crucial. Voice chat (default C) allows everyone (even the monster) to hear you so don't give away your position. Text chatting on the other hand is only seen by survivors. Memorizing the map layouts and how to avoid the certain monsters is very important, music changing is a big key in knowing there's a monster near you.   Items:  -Only pick up batteries when your flashlight is about to die, and don't pick up more than one you can only carry the one in your flashlight so don't waste them. -The crowbar is used to pry off wooden planks blocking doors from pressing left click on them. -Numerical codes written on paper open only certain safes. -Keys also only open certain doors so you'll be running back and forth a lot   Monsters:  Lurker A demon that has a spirit form where they sprint around the map invisible but unable to see or hear survivors. In this form the monster right clicks glowing objects to activate a trap, when a survivor walks past the trap, the object is set off alerting the monster the presence of a survivor. After 20 seconds of the start of the round you can activate physical form which makes you visible, and able to attack but walk much slower. The humans can out-run you and this form only lasts 40 seconds before going back to ghost form. Depending on how long you stay in the physical form, the longer the cool-down is for you to change back from ghost form to physical, so turn off physical form when not needed. If you're being chased, turned off your flashlight and sprint away, closing doors on them will block them out since Lurkers can't open doors.  Phantom The phantom is a ghost that can see you by hearing what you do, so shining your light on it and starring it down doesn't mean it knows where you are. When you do something loud such as sprinting, or anything interactive such as opening doors, turning on/off your flashlight and the phantom is near you, he will see you appear as bright white character (reverse silhouette) that can shine through obstacles and walls on his screen and chase you down. This ghost can go through doors, so don't bother closing doors, leave them open for your convenience! This monster requires more stealth then the others since you need to casual walk and stay still most of the time.  Mary A ghost girl that is an insanely slow character so if you see her just run away. Hiding from her is possible only if you can hide behind a door since that blocks her from charging her attack. Mary is ABLE open doors only in casual walking mode (as long as the doors are unlocked), so if she shes you in a room make sure to hold left-click and keep the door closed to prevent her from opening it behind you! Mary's main attack is Frenze which gives her 4x speed and attack to kill al survivors in her way! Luckily, she needs to charge it up to use it, mainly by being close to survivors. If a survivor is near, shines their flashlight on her, of if she even walks underneath a light (anything that 'disturtbs' the witch) she gains energy towards Frenzy mode. Her second ability is teleporting so she can very likely teleport in the room you're in. Her primary ability is a frenzy attack, if she stares at a survivor for roughly 10 seconds she can charge (twice as fast as your sprinting) for about 8 seconds and kill everyone in the way. The longer the round, the more energy Mary gains meaning that she can use her abilities faster and more often.   I would highly recommend this game for a group of friends looking to co-op on something, or if you're into survival horror games working as a team! There are still a lot of bugs but it's pretty stable. Also looking forward to the new monsters and features in the new future!  10/10\",\n",

The mission starts with ominous overtones and quickly descends into a survival game, using stealth to get one from A to B..and back to A when you've got lost using that mini-map. Frustrating and hard on 'hard' but why have it easy? I've spent 30 minutes in a darkened corridor with a synthetic looking right at me, only to move off 4 to 5 minutes later. Very intense; not because any game is actually scary, but because of the whole look of the game and the sound-effects are very well done. The creature itself will appear at certain times and definitely when you run or make too much noise. It's quick and you're dead. The only thing one can do is hide and sometimes (when in a locker) not even breathe. Speaking of which, can she bang those locker doors any louder?! :)  I'm only into the third mission but I'm thoroughly looking forward to working out how I can get around the ship with the least deaths. I'm glad it's going to be a long game - that's what we pay for. Don't expect to shoot, stab or blast your way out of trouble in this game, as the synthetics are hard to kill and trying will make a lot of noise.

Until you get the final godtier armor, many things can completely stop you in your tracks but can easily be overcome by skills. Possibly the hardest threshhold in this game is the jump from the normal game to hardmode, in which you go to hell below the world, get molten gear and fight the Wall of Flesh, who has 9000 hp, minions, high damage and constantly keeps you moving. You most likely have about 300-400 hp and maybe 30 defence max unless you max that out. Keep in mind theres lava everywhere and powerful monsters spawning about yet its a very doable fight and with that fight you enter a new mode which is perfectly proving your ready for this new hardmode.

They should have stuck with the original because they really didn't improve much at all. I would like to recommend this game, but the player base has just dropped because of their sequel.

       " (\"For a 2 bucks game, this one packs a lot of fun. Its mechanics are not great, the combat feel clumsy sometimes and later in the game your character got way overpowered with all the spells learnt and all gear upgraded. Evilquest is heavily based on a NES game called Crystalis and it gets the job done if you're expecting a good old school like game. It's not the best but I've played far worse games. it could be more polished.  The graphics are bland, the music sounds like midi files from a karaoke machine. Enemies are almost the same, just with color/power variations for example, in the beginning of the game you fight regular soldiers. As you progress, the soldiers are stronger and their colors change. Same thing with some monsters. There is also some little things in the game that looks like it is unfinished, like the jumping and charged shot abilities. Your character is told to use these features to solve puzzles, but I think only twice I've used the jump and charged shot to solve puzzles.  Overall it's a funny game to play in short bursts, as you can finish it in about 3-6 hours. I took longer because I like to explore every bit of the map and such. Also the funny bits of the game are entertaining, as you play with the villain this time. I'd recommend it for its low price if you like casual Zelda like clones. But if you are looking for a more retro feel and a challenging game, you should probably avoid this one. I'll give it a 6/10.\",\n",

The developers, Urban Games, have never clearly described fundamental game mechanics that are essential to understand how the flow of resources from primary producers to factories and towns actually work. Their previous game, Train Fever had exactly the same problem.   So unless you are willing to spend at least 20 hours playing this game using trial and error to work out what works and what doesn't (or have played Train Fever for 100+ hours) you will be greatly frustrated.  Urban games:   Please hire a decent translator (you are German, correct?) and put together a downloadable manual that once and for all describes in detail how the flow of resources along your lines works. Also clearly describe the 'line' system itself and how, in the interests of realism, trains will never dynamically choose a platform.   You are clearly hoping to attract OTTD / Transport Tycoon players. Therefore you need to explain how this game differs and why. It's fine to be opinionated in your game design and deviate from the OTTD mechanics, however you need to explain these choices in a manual.   The game looks great. The procedural landscapes are some of the best I have seen in this type of game, and the vehicle models look fantastic.

       " (\"Not so much a sequel, prequel, reimagining, or reboot of the original Shadow Warrior, but some combination of all four. It's surprisingly loyal to the source material, but gives more than enough of its own voice so it doesn't feel like it's needlessly pandering to a niche fanbase. Everything is vibrant and colorful to look at, especially at the beginning, though it falls off in acts two and three as you move to more drab, industrial environments.  The gameplay is simple but fun, mindless violence. If you like blood, this game has it in spades. Enemies don't just drop down dead; they go in pieces and explosions of blood that leaves areas coated in red. The genius of the game is that if you have a favored weapon, you can pretty much go through the entire game with that weapon and never feel like the you're being pressured to use something else. The combat itself is pretty much the same from beginning to end, with new enemies and new weapons and powers added over time, but it's done right so that it's never a chore in order to move on to the next level.  The sword was a fantastic weapon in the original game, and they made it even better in this. The sword feels sharp and powerful when you swing it, and when you cut something apart, the sound and the enemy reactions feels like you're cutting through flesh and bone, not just whacking a guy over the head with a stick until they die.  There are two major downsides, however. The first is that this game is very resource intensive, so if you don't have a powerful computer, forget it. The second is the bosses are the old three hit pattern bosses with glowing weak points. They aren't terrible, but it subtracts from figuring out the best way to kill the new enemy by having their weak points highlighted to you and forcing you to remove their armor in specific patterns.  Other than that, this game does everything right, and is a testament to what Duke Nukem Forever should have been.\",\n",

Tho it still felt cold at times, yet the funny moments made you look over it. Now, Borderlands 2 gave some warmth to it, the characters felt more alive (mainly to the fact that you are by now used to them as some are already from the last game, like the playable characters who are now important NPCs). In the first game, you had to find the vault key, stop Atlas, etc... In the second one, evil has a face, a handsome face in the form of Handsome Jack. But to the game elements itself. There are still bazzilions of guns, but there are much more diverse depending on the corporation that made them. The cartoonish graphics are back, and better than ever. The sounds are quite good. The voice acting is better mainly to the fact that there are more lines. Gun sounds again are neat. The story, like said, has a better grip on you. The return of the playable characters (Roland, Brick, Mordecai and Lilith), good ol' Claptrap, Scooter, Moxxi, Marcus,.... as well as some new, like, the propably craziest thirteen-year-old girl you will ever see in a video game, Tiny Tina. Anyone who played the original will know of the special abilities of the playable classes and the vehicular combat, but I shall repeat that. You get 4 classes (soldier, siren, gunzerker and assassin) without DLCs. Each has an RPG kind of leveling and unlocking skills. You can edit their looks in special stations for customatization. The combat is great and doesn't stop on running and gunning, but there is also driving and gunning. Vehicles are back. Not just a fast way to travell the map, but also a nice tool to crush your enemies. Aside the long-enough campaign, the co-op online mutliplayer is again one of the best in gaming in general, with up to 4 people joining together to fight the evils on Pandora and stop Jack (note: for each player that enteres the game, the game becomes slightly harder). After the regular SP, you get the option for a harder mode, going back to the starting point, just now, enemies will be on higher levels. Much later you get even more powerful bosses, which I recomend, if you ain't some crazy asian pro-gamer, to fight in a group of 4. You know the people saying how good Borderlands 2 is? Yes? They are freaking right, so go buy it\",\n",

I'm sure somebody will say that it is necessary to finish all episodes of WEE, but there is simply no good reason to continue if this is the level of quality.  Art, music, and presentation are all amateurish. There are few drawings available for the few characters, and even then it's relatively flat and simple illustrations. There are only a handful of music tracks, and they loop awkwardly. The generic presentation UI is bland at best. The translation is workaday, with a number of questionable choices.

You might think that it is just a Mario Kart clone with Sonic face on it but in actuallity, it is a really solid kart racer. I might say it is better than Mario Kart in some aspects.  However, the main mechanic of this game is the ability to change from a Boat, Car and Plane while on the race track. It may sound like a hassle in changing different gamestyle while playing however the changing of playstyle is natural and fun. Each of the game style have their own sets of physics and rules and controlling each vehicle is comfortable. Though try and play this with a gaming controller if possible and trying to press each button in a racing game will get uncomfortable fast.  The Aesthetics and the amount of references to Sega history will make long time Sega fans giddy. Having characters such as NiGHTS and Beat from Jet Set Radio racing through the Carrier Zone from AfterBurner is just beaurtiful. Also the remixed tracks is just delicious.   Onto the items. In Kart Racers, there is always that item which punishes the players just for being in First Place. However, in Sonic All- Star Racing Transformed the items are well balanced and not cheap. You have to actually aim the item for it to hit and even with the All Star Moves, it doesnt guarantee first place. So you got to aim your shots right to win in first place.  However, a criticsm I want to make is the way to unlock characters. In the previous installment, you have the ability to earn Sega Miles in which you can buy using in-game currency for the characters so you can essentially save to get that specific character. However, in this game, you are forced to go in the Career mode to get some of the characers unlock. You have to get to that tier while also reaching a certain threshold in the number of stars. meaning you have to play the certain mission in a harder difficulty. P.S. The S Ranks are brutal and can only be unlocked when you again reach a certain tier.  Overall, this game is just fantastic.

       " (\"First of all, I just have to say this, Alien Colonial Marines is not the bad game most meta critics talk about. Aliens Colonial Marines' actually a very good and solid game.  Another important aspect about the negative reviews is that most if not all are written for the console version of Aliens: Colonial Marines. The PC version is on all fronts way better. (Graphics are much better, no bugs, and solid fast controls)  And just to make a stand here. The gameplay and missions is the way it should be. We're taling about Aliens (Not Alien); so that means the 2nd movie and more precise: Colonial Marines. Intergalactic Warriors. They fight, they kill and they die. And they do that a lot. And that's what you get with this game. It's based upon Aliens and the Colonial Marines in an all out war for survival. You don't need to fear, because you got hightech weapons and you ain't got time to bleed.  Graphics: The graphics are far more than adequate, they're close to, if not already, top nodge.  Sound: The music is just the way it should be..Alien..a bit creepy, but cool. Nothing wrong with that. The weapons and other sound effects are just fine and help a lot to immerse the player.  Gameplay: Ha, yea, well, that's a different thing. The controls are perfect, everything works the way it should. No problems there. But..game falls with the quality of your gaming buddies. Aliens Colonial Marines provides a full Co-Op campaign (Even 2 with the dlc) But, the way you enjoy the campaign or the Co-Op Bug Hunt maps all comes down to your buddies. Are your buddies egocentric teenagers? Please, play solo, you'll have a better experience with the A.I. than with them. If you and your buddies can't get that special Alien feeling, then the game fails.  Combat isn't really that hard during the campaigns, which isn't bad,because it allows you to enjoy the story in full length and talk about it with your friends. (Or joke about). Me and my crew enjoyed the campaigns and we played it more than ones, just for the fun of it.  Okay, now the most interesting part..Bug Hunt. Yes, I know, been there, done that, lame... NOT. Not with this game. Bug Hunt makes you work together, because on your own you're nothing but prey, the next snack for your xenomorph friends. By killing you earn credits. With creadits you stock up on different types of ammo and or weapons and armor. Not to forget first aid.  I think I've put 15+ hours or so in Bug Hunt alone, so that makes me a nut or just a prove of concept concerning this game mode.  Besides just playing away you're also able to modify your weapons, look and voice. Depending on what and how many dlc's you've got for this game.  Still, if you're not sure if this game is good enough for you you should think about the following. This game has been designed by the people behind borderlands. A top nodge FPS Co-Op RPG. Now translate that over to Aliens Colonial Marines, without that many role playing parameters 'et voilá'. That gives you a good picture of what you get by buying this game.\",\n",

       " (\"I had bought this game a while ago, played it for half an hour and quit. I've decided to give it another shot. This is not a game I can recommend. Playing it feels tedious and here's why:  The 3 card limit is actually terrible, and feels terrible. I've only made it to the third stage, but I have found zero use for utility cards since I need all of the attack type cards possible. This means no heals, no traps, and no trap removal cards. You're limited to only three cards. If I kill stuff faster, I won't get hit.  There is no basic attack in this game, and the cards have a durability rating. You can physically see your cards becoming torn the more you use them. This leads perfectly into my next point about the tedious nature of the game.  When you kill a monster it leaves a loot bag on the floor. You can either choose to loot it right away, or leave it for later. Leaving them for later is actually the prefered choice so you don't run out of options for attacking. If enough of your cards become unusable from over use and no shrine to hopefully restore your cards are in sight, those loot bags can be a savior. These maps start becoming big after a while and navigating them just to check on the loot you left behind is annoying.  This game would have been better off with a tiny inventory system. You can keep X number of cards and potions in your inventory on standby. Suddenly those utlity cards and healing cards have a purpose. That potion you just picked up isn't instantly wasted because you're at full mana and health. The way the game is now makes me roll my eyes constantly. I have zero interest in going further than I already have in this game.\",\n",

       " (\"  Avadon 3 is an epic isometric CRPG. It has a really great story, quite some lore to explore, a world that is unbelievably big and detailed and interesting, turn-based party combat. I've played quite a bit more of the game than the few hours on my account are showing as I got a press pre-release version by the very nice guys from Spiderweb Software.  It is retro and indie, so there is sound but no music yet, the graphics are retro but they have high resolution and detail (HD) available. There is though, a game filled with love. It's just really fun. The Tutorial leads you into the game very well and the interface and quest system is actually really modern and easy to use. The urge to explore and find more in this action-, treasure and lore-laden world soon gets you and then you're on the hook. Like I am now!  At the start, you get sent out on missions and you can choose to take characters that you've met before with you. You have total control over them and also manage their attributes, skills and equipment. It is based on the mission how many people you can take with you, at the start you got your main character and a blademaster, a shadowwalker (some kind of thief/ninja) and a sorcerer at your disposal.  You can watch game footage in my Let's Play where I'm adding episodes three times a week. But the start should already show you most. In episode three you can see how the combat works, too.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sirMpByiXxg&amp;list=PLwfViAw_vAvLf8V-Ykk9dkQY1n0LO1Kbx   I got by this gem totally random, one of the friends of the producers wrote me an email if I wanted to preview the game (I got a small YouTube Gaming channel). I was curious and they were really nice, so I looked at the game and was really surprised and instantly knew I should have a look at the whole series.

Sure, sometimes you wander around for a while looking for items you need because there are no hints as to where stuff is, and the world is kinda small meaning you'll visit the same two places the whole game, but the world is pretty and the visuals are uniquely beautiful.   The story deals with the concept of Neuro-copies and a plague that forces most of mankind into 'M-bodies' (embody, get it?). You work to revive your flowerpot android and then the two of you will uncover both of your pasts as well as the history of nearby Gerbera Garden. This game is very story-driven with a LOT of dialogue and text to pay attention to.  Secondary to the story is solving puzzles as well as a platforming 'mini' game where you collect blocks. If you're even slightly familiar with Minecraft you'll understand the essence of the mini-games. As for the puzzles, they aren't terribly straightforward but also not ridiculously abstract. Finding items you'll need can take time, but given that your character has amnesia I suppose it makes sense to not really know where things are. For instance, I spent the better part of half an hour looking for roots to grind up to put in my bird soup only to find them right outside the front door.   Lastly, there are some flaws with how some story stuff doesn't appear to tie together at the end. Keep in mind it is entirely possible that I forgot some stuff because playing games on Ambien causes me to forget a LOT. Anyways, I imagine that the pieces I missed are probably actually there in the form of text items I missed. In fact, there is a LOT of flavor text. There is a bit of a problem discerning which pieces of text are 'flavor' and which are 'main ingredients' at times though.   Anyways, if you want something with a good story, is fairly short (Maybe 4-6 hours including stumbling around looking for roots which are right outside the front door), has a nice puzzle aspect, and doesn't like quite like anything else I've ever seen; get this game.

It feels like it has too much of side-content (not directly related to story or missions) and become quite repetitive at the end: defusing mines (30 encounters is waaaay too many, only first 15 mines are fun, rest 75 is booring), clearing camps, scarecrows.  Point is: you learn about 90% of game in first few (1-3) encounters and the rest is a boring repetition. Only occasionally game suprises with unexpected mechanic or encounter. E.g. one camp had elevator to move up, it took me 20 min to realise it's not non-interactive environment and I actually have to use it..  Racing is easy, but.. big but.. the balance is poor. In general all death races are VERY easy with archangels (boost + weapons), while first car in the list to beat it is sometimes VERY hard. Some routes required studying by failng race several times to find working shortcuts. Race during night is really poor experience, especially when car has NO lights.. &gt;&lt;  Quests: some are very unclear/poorly designed, including main quest where you have to build your first archangel. NOT a single player is capable to complete it without googling.  I must admit one good thing: encouters are varying enough. You will not notice copy/paste, because there is none. Searching for valuables is fun and sometimes hard (e.g. a symbol located on the back of the letter on the roof, or well hidden container).. though for my taste it's too easy. I'd enjoy having more puzzles, having to scout more.  On-foot combat is intuitive and simple, yet satisfactory. I generally dislike melee characters in games, but in Mad Max it was very fun.

Such a true masterpiece!  GOOD: +++ Music (I still listen to the soundtrack at work every now and then) + Superb voice acting + Incredible &amp; believable story + Varied strategy (ie: going blind and shooting will GUARANTEE you lose)  BAD: - Learning curve was/is steep. Movement in 3D is tricky with the interface. - Could be a little slow if you're into 'steal everything mode' (Though it makes for an inpressive fleet) - Can be punishing if you're not careful (EG: HW2 will pit against ships that exploit your ships weakness, making the game sometimes unnecesarily difficult).  [REMAKE] This is a very good remake (even the old actors were brought back). Note to other developers: This is how you remaster a game. My only complaint the engine of HW2 was 'back-ported' into HW, and thus the behaviour of ships is a little odd (ie. fighter wont exlusively focus on attacking bombers, defense formations aren't as effective as the originals)...

I'm impressed with the writer's ability to portray young people in a way that is realistic and not trying too hard to be 'hip' - Oxenfree is really what I wanted from Life Is Strange.   There were definitely a couple of minor issues I had with the game, the 2 most obvious/frustrating (to me) being the following:  - A bug in the very beginning of the game, where an AI character who is following you will get 'stuck' trying to climb rocks. I've seen this topic come up in the forums multiple times (the earliest I saw was from January) with the only fix suggested being 'restart and replay the section'. This definitely doesn't ruin the game, but it is frustrating when you're trying to experience a story and have to disrupt that for such an insignificant detail.  - I'd like to see some way of implementing multiple save options to more easily experience the different potential story outcomes, like a lot of other choice-heavy games have. This is also not too significant since it is such a short game, but it'd definitely be a welcome update.\",\n",

It is a simple split into weapon/upgrade skills and so-called 'powers' which turn you into a vicious killing machine.  The gameplay reminds me of Bioshock, Fallout and the Elder Scrolls series plus you get the feeling of playing super assasins like 47 or the assasins from Assasin's Creed - but on a very different level.

I took most of the time to upgrade all gear and find all the posts/tower before doing anything. I, however, found that the game became EXTREMELY easy afterwards.

The game has main areas with doorways that lead to realms of gods you have to defeat and eventually you can reach the big boss, Zeus. That's a pretty simplified but accurate description of the game but they use several things to give it more depth: side quests/crafting/simple upgrade system/large variety of weapons/simple puzzles.  Controls feel a little different from regular platformers because there is momentum in your movement and the arc of your attack changes based on your position, angle, and weapon choice.  If you enjoy the idea of Greek mythology, the theme will pull you in. If you're very familiar with Greek mythology, this game is based on and refers to the mythology but isn't something that really goes deep into it. It's a challenge the gods story and that doesn't really lend to very deep storytelling.

This game is more like the Dark Souls of goat simulation and could be the deepest non-linear action rpg of our time.  You start out in an open field with perhaps the most cliched of beginings, the amnesiac hero. Much in the vein of dark souls you know little about the world to begin with and will learn more through close observation of details. What's the deal with the standing stone circle? Who is behind the sinister experiments in the anti gravity science facilty? These are questions that you'll answer in your journey along with many more.  Narrative is driven purely through your interactions with npcs. This is some of the best npc interaction I have seen as each npc has their own digital life and routine and they will remember your past interactions. Did you headbutt Kyle earlier? Well he's staying headbutted. The only gripe I have with the NPCs is that the AI is particularly poor and they only react directly to the player rather than to the world around them. However due to the non-linear nature of the game and story, this should be forgiven.  Graphics are great and highly stylised. The world is vibrant and full of colour, making it easy to distinguish objects on screen. Likewise, the music is perfect and even contextual, ramping up at times of extreme action.   Final word: Simple to learn, difficult to master with engaging gameplay and a deep and compelling non-linear narrative, Goat Simulator is a modern day classic and a must buy for all gamers, casual or hardcore.

However, the genre is not entirely forgotten, with the occasional title like Syder Arcade coming along.  The best that I can describe it for old-school gamers is to take an R-Type or Thunderforce IV, and give it controls akin to Defender where you can turn around and have a long range radar.  For those not familiar with the genre, you're a lone spaceship that has to kill lots and lots of enemies. You can move at any angle, but generally enemy attacks come from the left and right of you. There are lots of items to collect to power up your guns. There are several stages to complete, most of which are the get-to-the-end variety, but also an escort mission, and there are a few bosses to defeat as well.  First the good part - the graphics are bright and colorful, and even when the bullets come heavily you can usually tell where you are and what's going on. The controls are tight, and there are several types of ships that change gameplay quite significantly. There are a variety of skill levels to insure that novices and experts alike can enjoy the game without too much frustration. The music is good, and it's a generally fun game.  It's not perfect, however. There are not a ton of stages to play, and they lack variety. The bosses are rather similar and unimaginative. The tacked on story is skip-worthy.

To begin with this game is NOT 'pay to win' it never really was but in the past about 2% of players shelled out the extra cash for some better units. Now there is NO cash shop. Instead you earn an extra type of currency called crowns by doing PVP. You can literally spend the first 24 hours of in game time just building up your city and levelling up units WITHOUT worryinging about being attacked. Your 12 hour immunity to attack BEGINS when you decide to build walls and you can hold off on the walls for 12 hours so you have a nice army and city ready to give any attackers a run for their money. The game matches you based on army strength so even when you do finally decide to PVP you will not be getting owned by players with much stronger armies, this is not the D-Bag gank festival that other PVP oriented games tend to be.

Again, however, WftO now stands out as the best and the brightest of the DK-alikes out there (although, with Dungeons 2 as its only real competitor these days --with maybe KeeperRL as a very distant 3rd -- that's not saying much).  + Tried and tested Dungeon Keeper gameplay with its own spin. That's the biggest plus right there. After many patches, the dev team pretty much nailed what makes the DK formula special. This single plus pretty much covers up for the game's myriad sins:  - Campaign needs another pass. One big quibble is the way that new units and tools are dumped willy-nilly on the player, with no warning or explanation, as the campaign progresses. DK made sure that new stuff was properly introduced -- and necessary! -- at the end of each campaign mission. WftO doesn't.  - Poor use of all this new and different stuff in the campaign. You get a lot of different toys and units, but you will not end up using some of them at all in the campaign. (See: stone bridge). This may be useful when playing multiplayer, but it's just clutter in the campaign. Even read a book that cries out for better editing, for elimination of dross and a better focus on what is important? WtfO needed a better editor, as it were. There's just too much redundant stuff in it. DK2 stripped away a lot of DK1's units and tools, as was the better game for it.  - Much more MP focused than the DK games were. WftO was evidently created by folks who thought DK's MP was the high point of the game, which is arguable. As a result, you get less of a contemplative, polish your dungeon to a high sheen gameplay in favor of... zerg rushes and click-click-clicky around the map.  - I was wondering if the devs were trolling me when I 'won' the game. Abrupt and unrewarding to say the least. Not as bad, say, as an old NES game that just displayed 'CONGRATULATIONS' on a black screen, but close.  - I hate timed missions in a game centered on building stuff. The campaign has a few.  TL;DR: WtfO is close, but not quite, for those who waited patiently over the decades for a DK3. It's definitely still worth a shot, though.    \",\n",

       " (\"Greyfox is sort of a role playing game... in that you assume the roles of various characters throughout the game. It's basically like a point and click adventure type game, but instead of pointing and clicking you have RPG type controls and environments. The basic plot is that you, the main character, get sick of your day to day life. You decide to quit your job and move to the small town of Greyfox, which is inhabited mainly by elderly people. You quickly get into a scenario where you are forced to live a day in the life of someone in town. This happens multiple times. This is essentially all you do in the game, without going into spoiler terrirory about what happens with each character.  The gameplay, as mentioned, is basically going around, examining the environments, talking to people, getting items, and trying to use items to complete tasks within the game. Some things can be missed but others are necessary to progress. You will get to pick different options in some dialogues. The answers sometimes have consequences and sometimes don't matter. At the end of each day, you get to decide whether the character you've played as lives or dies. After all the days, there's a final cutscene and the game ends.   I liked how the game played, as opposed to actual point and click games. The RPG playstyle and art style helped me get into it more than some visual novel or point and click adventure normally would. I also like how the game gives you choices that may or may not matter. In fact, and this may be a bit of a spoiler but it doesn't really matter ultimately, in the end all of your choices have no true consequences aside from how you personally feel about them. This is a pretty cool idea, to let you feel how you want to about what you've chosen as the fate of these people. The way you play is determined by your own set of values moreso than those of the developers. It's also nice to play some depressing games now and then. It's not necessarily a happy ending, but it can be as long as you feel like it is. It's just a neat little concept.  On the downside, there's also no true goal of this game. The rather aimless nature is strung along by a few integral decidions that you have to make and actions you have to do in order to move on. You can't really lose the game. So there's no real goal here. There IS replay value to see what happens if you do different things, but there's not a lot of incentive when it goes against your own values to make such choices, especially in a game that is so fueled on such choices. Also, many times during the game certain places will be closed off to you. This doesn't feel like it's all that natural. It just seems like they didn't program interesting things in those areas for the entire game so only areas where you'd need to go are programmed in. It's okay, but feels a little lacking and as though it's trying to herd you in the right direction... in a game that's about exploring the world in other people's shoes. Also, a minor complain about the art. I like it, but it seems like a lot of it is just assests from some RPG maker. Not a big deal in terms of the story and atmosphere, but still a little lazy on some of it.  Overall? Greyfox is a fun, interesting little game. It'll probably only last you one to two hours to finish... which means you'll either want to achievement hunt or idle it to get the card drops. It's not for everyone, and I wouldn't call it an RPG, but if you like the concept of exploring the lives of old people and choosing their fate, then look into it. Is it worth the full 5 bucks? I would say no, personally. BUT, if you can get it for around 50 cents or less, it's definitely worth a shot. Maybe a dollar if you're really interested. It's just not long enough or deep enough to be worth full price. Greyfox gets a 5 out of 10 for being a fun, interesting little adventure where personal values and investment in the characters really pay off.\",\n",
