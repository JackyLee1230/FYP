      "I wish I could recommend this game - I really do. I've been a great fan of Micro Machines V3 and was looking for a similar modern game. At its heart it's still Micro Machines but there are too many negatives:   Only 5 hrs of single-player fun   Tracks are short and repetitive (and there are not many of them)   I preferred the cleaner visual style of MM series   I miss the 'garden', 'sandbox' and 'bathtub' themes   On the other hand we have to mention the pros:   Great controls   Low system requirements   Great new game-modes   If you can get it on a 66-75% discount, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, I would recommend 'Little Racers STREET'.\n",

Otherwise, I would recommend 'Little Racers STREET'.\n",
