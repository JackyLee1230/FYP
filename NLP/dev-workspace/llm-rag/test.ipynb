       " 'documents': ['Dota 2 review – eSport of kings\\n\\nMr Pinkerton\\nPublished Jul 19, 2013, 1:00am | Updated Dec 9, 2019, 5:35pm\\n\\nThe original is already one of the most popular video games in the world, but what is Dota and why have Half-Life makers Valve created this sequel?\\n\\nWe’ve never heard anyone talk about League of Legends or Dota in real life. We don’t know any friends that play them and we don’t even recall any fellow journos discussing them. Nor do we remember anyone writing into the Inbox about them. And yet on any given day they have over 10 million people playing them, and the mere announcement of Dota 2’s existence was enough to crash the websites reporting it.',\n",
       "  'This juxtaposition between objective success and subjective celebrity has always been an issue for PC games, where their lack of prominence on the high street and in sales charts (due to most being purchased digitally) makes them all but invisible to most mainstream gamers. The same will certainly be true of Dota 2, which has no plans for a retail release or any interest in normal video game marketing.\\n\\nAlthough the significance of the game’s name has now largely been lost, originally DotA stood for Defense Of The Ancients. It began life in 2003 as a fan-created mod for Warcraft III, inspired by the Aeon of Strife map for the original Starcraft. Its original creator has long since left the scene and the concept is now overseen by the anonymous ‘IceFrog‘, who was invited to lead a team at Half-Life creator Valve to create this sequel.',\n",
       "  'One really important thing that has to be appreciated about Dota 2 when compared to other MOBAs is the quality of everything that goes into it. From the excellent voice acting, the character lines and their interactions to the fact that you will rarely see a glitchy animation or something that looks wonky. It’s built and worked on to near perfection in terms of gameplay mechanics.\\n\\nIn Dota 2 the rules are pretty simple. You have a pool of heroes grouped by their main attributes (strength, agility and intelligence), out of which you pick one and join your other four team members in the arena. Once there, your end goal is to destroy the other team’s base, more importantly their Throne.\\n\\nThere are three lanes to push, creeps to farm, neutrals to kill for extra gold, runes to snatch for a bit of an advantage, Rosh to kill for the Aegis and loads more to do. Passed these key elements of gameplay Dota 2 has countless more layers that give it lots of depth.',\n",
       "  'How a game unfolds depends entirely on your play style, reflexes and why not, a practiced talent. Ideally it would be for everyone to play their part/role, supports should support, carries should farm up and take advantage of every kill possibility and so on. If you get matched up with a team that’s focused on bringing their collective A game, not the individual one, you’re going to have a great experience with Dota 2.\\n\\nThe vast number of skill combinations, precise executions and outside the box plays makes this game incredibly captivating and if you manage to pull off a great gank or a good team fight, it’s also very rewarding. The intensity of some battles can get to you, in a good way.',\n",
       "  'If you’re just starting out with Dota 2, be prepared for a lot of raging, smack talk, intentional feeding, racist remarks and generally bad manners. The community that stands behind this game is what will make you despise the game a lot of the time because egos in Dota 2 are real. It’s not what you can call a deal breaker but it certainly will lower the enjoyment factor. However, that experience gets left behind as you get better and make less mistakes or care less about other people’s mistakes.\\n\\nOn a closing note, Dota 2 is utterly great if you have the mind and patience to overlook its social interaction aspect. Team cooperation and tactics are key in most cases and very few games are won thanks to just one person playing flawlessly. It’s a team game, a team sport.',\n",
       "  'To get the best out of Dota 2, find someone to partner up and play. Whether it’s one or two friends, having someone to coordinate skills and tactics with makes a huge difference and it opens up the game to you in a different way. Teamplay is the only way to play.',\n",
       "  \"Dota 2 Review\\n\\nDota 2 is complicated, exhausting, and sometimes cruel, but its many complexities form an incredibly satisfying and exciting multiplayer game.\\n\\nBy Martin Gaston  on November 5, 2013 at 6:14PM PST\\n\\nDota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.\",\n",
       "  \"If you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map. Each team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.\",\n",
       "  \"Aiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.\",\n",
       "  \"Your individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.\"],\n",

      "Based on a mod for Warcraft 3 in the mid 2000s, Dota 2 bears a great deal of the RPG-infused RTS gameplay that defined Blizzard's series — so much, in fact, that some characters in Dota 2 and Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm share identical voicelines.\n",

      "According to the reviews, there are several bugs and issues in Dota 2 that players have encountered. For example, Arthur Gies mentions spending over 4,700 hours playing the game, but still feels unsure about writing a review due to the complexity and frustration it can provide. Martin Gaston notes that the game is \"sometimes cruel,\" while also acknowledging its rewarding nature for those who commit to learning its many complexities. The reviews also mention that the game's design is sometimes overwhelming, with dozens of elements affecting the game at once. However, there is no mention of bugs or glitches in the provided reviews. Therefore, the answer is NA: Bug.\n",

That's more than I've played any other game, ever. Sometimes I wonder if it's more than every other game combined, though that seems unlikely.\\n\\nSo, closer to 5,000 hours than not in Dota 2, and I still feel some trepidation about writing a review of it. It is without a doubt the most confusing, infuriating, disorienting, unforgiving game I've ever played.\\n\\nI also think it might be my favorite game.

On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.\", metadata={'source': 'dota2/dota2_03.txt'}), Document(page_content='After all, it takes that long just to master the game and it’ll take considerably longer than that to get tired of it.\\n\\nIn Short: Gaming’s ultimate eSport gets a well-considered makeover by the masters at Valve, although new ideas, and fixes for old problems, are currently thin on the ground.\\n\\nPros: A game of near infinite depth and variety that rewards dedication and teamwork with a brilliantly social experience. Attractive new presentation and generous free-to-play options.\\n\\nCons: More of an update than a sequel, offering few new ideas.
