    "long_review_01 = '''I'm only writing this review because Shadow of the Erdtree was finally announced and I want to go on the record for anyone who never got around to playing it yet for whatever reason. If you heard about the DLC and are thinking \"yeah, maybe now is the time I'll finally dive in\", then this is directed at you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elden Ring is not for everyone. If you don't respect the grind, then it will kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of you without remorse. There is no easy mode, no save-scumming, no cheat codes, and absolutely no hand holding. Yeah sure.. you can rely on Youtubers and Wiki pages to tell you what some of the ULTIMATE BUILDS might be... but even if you're relying on a crutch like that, you STILL have to put the work in and \"git gud\" when it's all said and done. It also takes a while to even get access to all the weapons/gear that those guides expect you to be using, not to mention earning the experience needed for the build to be viable. So my suggestion to you is to worry less about building an exact carbon copy of a character that some other person already played as, and just try to take it all in and experience it for yourself first.\n",
    "\n",
    "I got every achievement, defeated every boss, and it was the most rewarding grind I've ever embarked upon in a game. I made a lot of mistakes along the way, but I learned from every single one of them. I got my ass kicked every time I booted up the game, but every triumph I celebrated was unlike any other thanks to all of those ass-kickings. From the hardest boss fights to the most annoying mobs, you truly feel every single victory... and that's where I got hooked because the sense of accomplishment you get from progressing in Elden Ring... I'm telling you, it is the ultimate dopamine shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I personally loved the story, but it's definitely a subjective experience. Elden Ring is a mythological story about gods and demi-gods, and if you take the time to read through the item descriptions, look closer at the game world, and try to fill in the gaps kind of like a detective would, then you will probably enjoy it too. If you are expecting the cutscenes to be the only thing you have to pay attention to in order to know what's going on, you might be disappointed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a quest menu or anything like that to keep track of things, the game forces you to do your own due diligence and keep track of the NPCs you've spoken to, and to really listen to what they say because completing side quests isn't like most open world games that just plop a waypoint down for you to walk to after you've skipped all the dialogue. You need to listen and think about it, and if you've already progressed through certain points of the main-story, then you might not even get to experience some of the side quests. This aspect of Elden Ring can be a bit frustrating because you really aren't given any indication if you've missed a part of a quest or if you missed a quest entirely until it's too late. I will just say that if you're bee-lining it straight to the main bosses, you are definitely missing a LOT of what makes the game so good (and you're also missing out on side quests that lead to valuable ITEMS and EXPERIENCE!!!). So if you don't want to miss anything, my advice is to take it all very slow, and just try to clear regions and talk to everyone you see before moving on to new areas. If you think you missed stuff, keep in mind that you can always try again in NG+.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplayer is completely optional, but opting in to allow invasions can be rewarding because testing your build against actual players is pretty fun, plus you get to also see what other people are doing with their characters. Sometimes seeing someone else in action can inspire you to try new stuff, or it can make you aware of a flaw in your own character. I will say that I personally played with the player messages turned off though because I didn't want to read possible spoilers, and I felt reading messages left by other players all over the place broke my immersion.. but to each their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've never played Elden Ring before and are finally considering a run through the game for the first time... I truly envy you because I would do anything to wipe my memory and play it again for the first time. It is a game like no other, and it will test you in more ways than one. Just don't get discouraged when you hit a wall.. because we've ALL been there... all you have to do is learn to overcome it. Once you do, I promise there is no greater feeling in all of gaming.'''\n",

    "long_review_03 = '''Since the release of Skyrim on 11/11/11 I have been craving an open world experience with rewarding combat, build theories, crazy-beautiful aesthetics, and a real sense of accomplishment (items, dungeons completed, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "This game delivers the entire experience in a way I've never quite seen. I'm new to the souls-like genre, and FROMSOFTWARE games. Here are the takeaways for me:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Combat is extremely rewarding by being unforgiving. At first glance, it's hard, but as you delve just a little deeper you realize that combat in this game is an art form that takes practice, and then more practice. The satisfaction is higher than any game I've played in the last decade. The light attacks, heavy attacks, blocks, parrying, sprint attacks, sneak attacks, all play a little different and allow you to really pick your method or avenue of approach.\n",
    "2. Items in game (from armor and weapons, to craftables and ashes) are each, individually, potentially game changing or build changing and can really flesh out a 'build'. It's rewarding to find items in game as any one of them could be the weapon of choice for your desired build.\n",
    "3. Open world is absolutely stunning and feels very scary, yet very exciting. Every new enemy seen needs to be studied, practiced, and learned for optimal combat. New enemies can be scary as you don't immediately know their capabilities. Boss fights are hard (some more than others) and many enemies are the type that require you to come back at a later time when you have stronger tools, or more HP, or you git gud. Roaming new areas is thrilling and you begin to truly have to balance and manage your HP, FP, and Stamina while in combat. The lighting in caves with torches or lanterns is immersive and you feel the danger.\n",
    "4. Character building is straightforward. You level up as you beat enemies and use the runes (XP, currency) as you see fit to either purchase things, or level up....etc and you can decide what attribute to increase. Trying new weapons, new armors, is both fun and interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need to knows:\n",
    "1. Game won't hold your hand. You are in a labyrinth with many things that all can kill you. You will not know exactly what you're doing, where you're going, or why you are existing.\n",
    "2. Everything you see can kill you if you become too careless. Slow and steady usually is the best method. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.\n",
    "3. Ashes of War, summoning and crafting must be experimented with to understand. Again, no hand holding.\n",
    "4. You will ask yourself, \"How in the world am I supposed to ever be able to complete this?\" Many, many times.\n",
    "5. Puzzles and secrets abound, exploration and a good memory are key.\n",
    "6. While there is a multiplayer experience (PVP and PVE) it's a bit confusing and from what I've experienced so far, not necessarily mandatory. The single player experience is strong with this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've spent 42 hours in this game as of writing this and I've barely left the starting area - Limgrave. My nightmares consist of Runebears, traversing the mist, and boss fights. I've been startled, pillaged, rekt, and absolutely confused many times, but I wouldn't change any of it. I remember the first time I saw a giant I had Attack on Titan flashbacks and began trying to summon my inner Captain Levi. It's just a blast. An absolute blast. The greatest feeling of accomplishment is when you start to beat bosses or new enemies on your first attempt. You can feel your ability, your reaction time, your muscle-memory coming more and more into play as you practice, and it creates a thrilling experience. Struggling with an enemy type for hours only to come back a few days later and realize how much stronger and faster you've gotten is a very rewarding experience.'''\n",

    "~16 hours for 100% completion, and ~21 hours for 100% achievements is just too short for this game to be worth a buy at full price. You also get fewer gadgets and they feel rather uninspired. While I enjoyed using all 8 gadgets in the first game, I found myself mainly using only 2 in this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "And while this game is inferior to the first in almost every way, 2018's Spider-Man set such a ridiculously high standard that simply sharing the same core gameplay still makes this game great. So if you enjoyed the first game, this is definitely worth the play, but definitely only get it at at least 25% off unless you're impatient like me.'''\n",

It never really gets old to web-sling through an accurate depiction of New-York City. The story and game play was enjoyable enough for me to at least want a game play session in everyday. The story had like able characters and not one really stood out to me as a bad character. Graphics are amazing and as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the game did miss two marks for me. One big gripe I had with the game was the overall playtime. If we disregard side missions and the open-world activities, we are looking at 6-7 hours of main mission playtime. It also does not help that the first game doubles this playtime. It only took me around 22 hours to complete the game 100%. Another issue I could not look over was the lack of memorable boss fights, its hard not to compare it to the first game but, the first game did have many good boss fights against Spider-Man's iconic villains. This game did not even reach to half of that. Although, the final boss was a banger.\n",

    "But it didn't last - you knew this was coming. From the outside and when you just dip your finger in, it certainly looks like there's a lot to Starfield, but you eventually realise that there really isn't. A mile wide and an inch deep encapsulates this game perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are good things about Starfield, make no mistake. But nearly without fail, it's stunted by the bad things and prevented from actually being great. Let's look at an example: shipbuilding in this game is really fun. You can look at what so many players have managed to create. That's where it ends, though, because as with many other things here - THERE'S NOTHING TO IT. Your ship is basically a glorified fast travel terminal. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's also outpost building. It seems really cool, you know, going out there into the vast unknown and building your own little slice of home there. But, again, THERE'S NOTHING TO IT. Once you build your first one just to see how cool it is, you quickly realise that there isn't really any more of a point to doing so.\n",
    "\n",
    "That brings me nicely to exploration. Who the hell at Bethesda played this and thought \"hey, it will be fun!\" because it isn't. You can't land wherever you want on the planet as you can in, say, No Man's Sky. You have to point at where you want on the map, and then through a few loading screens, you finally arrive into your allotted fishbowl. I call it a fishbowl because that's precisely what it is, and it's not a particularly interesting one either. You slow jog around for a while to see the usual points of interest that are replicated on every other planet in the game, no matter its character, from supposedly civilised and settled ones, all the way to the ones which are supposed to be more 'undiscovered'. No matter what, you'll find all the same things. It's especially puzzling when it comes to the temples in game - a temple that has supposedly been undiscovered for centuries by humans is only a few hundred metres away from a human settlement of some form. It simply makes no sense. Then after slow jogging around this fishbowl, you will be hit with an invisible wall. Oh, and did I mention that it has no land vehicles of any sort? What the hell is a space exploration game without a space buggy? I also don't think I need to mention that it's unacceptable to have so many loading screens from a game released in 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can't begin to state how much of a better design decision it would have been for Starfield to have only a few planets that were handcrafted without invisible walls or random generation, or at least, that kept to a minimum. But they sold that away for the \"1,000 planets\" marketing gimmick. Beautiful handcrafted worlds are the bread and butter of Bethesda's games. It's why we love them and more importantly, why we put up with the bugs and the other misgivings. Without that, what does the game have? Nothing. And that's where we're at with Starfield.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, I feel that Bethesda may have just lost it. Other game companies have put out far superior titles with features that are better than in Starfield, or they're actually present in the first place. It's like they're sitting on a sugar high from the Skyrim days (and even then, the game has actually gone backwards in several respects). They need to wake up and move on, because everyone else has. They also talk about how this game is their 'passion project' that they've wanted to make since Morrowind. If this is their passion project, you should be very, very concerned about what comes next.'''"

However, they do not mention anything about the accessibility of the game, so the answer is NA.\", \\'Sound\\': \\'\\\\nBased on review_01, the aspect of the game related to sound is:\\\\n\\\\nThe game has a random algorithm for shuffling the deck, which can lead to either hitting a major mana pocket or no mana at all for half of the deck, regardless of deck size. The reviewer suggests allowing specific card buying for coins, as it is difficult to obtain a single card from an entire set of cards, and the cost should be higher than for booster packs, adjusted for card value and rarity. There is no mention of sound-related issues in the review, so the answer is NA.\\', \\'Graphics & Art Design\\': \"\\\\nBased on review_01, the aspect of the game that can be extracted is:\\\\n\\\\nGraphics & Art Design. The reviewer does not mention anything specific about the game\\'s graphics or art design in their review, so the answer is NA.\", \\'Performance\\': \"\\\\nBased on review_01, the aspect of the game related to performance is the random algorithm for shuffling the deck. The reviewer mentions that the algorithm can lead to either a major mana pocket or no mana at all for half of the deck, regardless of deck size. This suggests that the game\\'s shuffling mechanism may not be as random or unbiased as it could be, potentially affecting the performance of the game. NA.\", \\'Bug\\': \"\\\\nBased on the review provided, the aspect of the game that can be extracted is:\\\\n\\\\nBug\\\\n\\\\nThe reviewer mentions the random algorithm for shuffling the deck, which they feel can lead to unpredictable outcomes. They also suggest that the deck size should be adjusted based on the number of players to avoid any issues with mana pockets or lack thereof. Therefore, it can be inferred that there are some bugs or issues with the game\\'s shuffling mechanism and deck size calculation.\", \\'Suggestion\\': \"\\\\nThe suggestion made in the review is to allow specific card buying for coins. The reviewer suggests that it is difficult to obtain a single card from an entire set of cards and recommends increasing the cost of card buying to reflect the card\\'s value and rarity. NA\", \\'Price\\': \\'According to review_01, the price of the game is a concern for some players. They suggest that the cost of buying specific cards should be higher than for booster packs, adjusted for card value and rarity. However, the reviewer does not provide any concrete information on the pricing of the game, so I can only answer \"NA\" for this aspect.\\', \\'Overall\\': \\'\\\\nBased on review_01, the overall aspect of the game is good. The reviewer mentions that it is an \"overall good magic card game,\" indicating that the game is well-designed and enjoyable to play. While they mention a few issues with the random algorithm for shuffling the deck and the difficulty in obtaining specific cards, the overall assessment of the game is positive.\\'}'"
