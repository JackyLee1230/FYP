       " 'documents': [\"Cyberpunk 2077 Review\\nCyberpunk 2077 has standout side quests and strong main characters, though its buggy, superficial world and lack of purpose bring it down.\\nBy Kallie Plagge  on December 15, 2020 at 3:59PM PST\\n\\nEditor's note (December 15, 2020): The following review of Cyberpunk 2077 is based on the PC version of the game, as GameSpot did not receive console codes for the game until its release on December 10. There is a significant disparity in performance on PS4 and Xbox One compared to the PC version of Cyberpunk 2077 (as well as the console version running on PS5 and Xbox Series X). Developer CD Projekt Red has acknowledged the last-gen console version's poor performance, even offering refunds to disappointed players--though there is no specific arrangement to guarantee said refunds--and promising patches in early 2021.\",\n",
       "  \"You can watch our base PS4 vs. PS5 comparison video to get a feel for how Cyberpunk 2077 plays on different hardware, but as it stands, GameSpot cannot recommend you play Cyberpunk 2077 on last-gen consoles; the frame rate is wildly inconsistent to the point of severe interference with gameplay, and frequent texture pop-in and poor visual quality overall make Night City muddy and ugly to look at. These versions also feature the litany of bugs we experienced on PC. We will revisit this when significant patches arrive, as well as when the game is officially released on next-gen consoles (it's currently only backwards compatible on PS5 and Series X, though the game performs far better on next-gen hardware already). The original PC review, published on December 7, 2020, continues below.\",\n",
       "  'Once I got a good cyberdeck and equipped better quickhacks, combat really picked up for me. I had a quickhack that reset an enemy\\'s optics--pretty much everyone in Night City has cyberware in place of organic eyes--and temporarily blinded them, which allowed me to sneak past. I was able to shut off entire camera systems easily and set turrets to \"friendly mode\" so they wouldn\\'t shoot me on sight. I approached most encounters like a puzzle: I\\'d hack into the camera systems to see how many enemies I was dealing with, then figure out who to distract and in which direction so I could move from room to room undetected. If that didn\\'t work, I at least knew I could jam their weapons or shock their systems from afar.\\n\\nWhen I found my rhythm and found the cash, I really enjoyed quickhacking as an alternative approach to combat, and it was always satisfying to get in, steal a bunch of money off some computers, and get out without being spotted.',\n",
       "  'When it finally released, the console versions were so buggy as to be unplayable, and both digital and physical retailers expanded their refund policies to accommodate anyone who wanted to return the game. Here at RPGFan, one reviewer was unable to finish even the game’s prologue on PC before the game crashed permanently. With the copy I personally purchased on PC, I had better luck and was able to play all the way to the end credits with only minor glitches.\\n\\nSo, do I factor those elements into my score because they’re a part of the game’s ecosystem, or do I leave them out unless they impact my particular experience? In the end, I hope to walk the tightrope and find a balance between the two.',\n",
       "  'In Cyberpunk 2077, you play a character known only as V who takes a page from the Dragon Age: Origins book and starts in one of three places of your choice. After a short prologue, all three stories converge in the same area, but you have dialogue options related to your specific backstory throughout the game. The main story deals with a question at the heart of the cyberpunk genre: what does it mean to be human? It’s a difficult question, and I don’t know that this game attempts to give a definitive answer so much as it tells one person’s struggle to decide what it means to them and what they feel is justifiable in the pursuit of holding onto their humanity and defining a legacy for themselves.',\n",
       "  'I’m told that the main story could be completed in only 20 hours or so, but those missions are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what this game has to offer. I played the final story mission at about the 70 hour mark so that I could write a review, but there may still be that amount of content again for me to play. There are a lot of side quests to go on with characters like Keanu’s, and you don’t want to miss that, because it’s great stuff. It’s worth pointing out a number of these characters are middle-aged or older women, which is pretty unusual and cool. The nature of tech in the Cyberpunk universe means they don’t look as old as their birthdate says they are, but they’re not 20 and they don’t act like they are.',\n",
       "  'The world map is jam packed with side gigs from taking out some very bad people by any means necessary to sneaky heists where getting caught means failure. Some are silly. Others will stick with you long after you’re done, wondering if you made the right choice not as a character in a game that will likely be unaffected by that side mission, but as the player who made the choice. What this game offers in that respect is truly outstanding.',\n",
       "  'Assuming you can play the game at all, its gameplay really shines. When given the option, I tend to play games as a sneaky sniper type, popping my head out to zap an enemy without being noticed, and this game definitely allowed for that just as well as it allowed for those who like to break down the front door and start tossing grenades. In one infiltration mission, I stopped and counted at least six possible ways I could have gotten to my target, and at that point, I didn’t even have the leg enhancements that gave me a fifteen foot vertical leap. There were only two points in the game where I was trapped in a small space with no real cover and no choice but to fight, and although it took a couple of tries, I was able to get through them without wanting to throw my controller.',\n",
       "  'There are multiple types of guns on offer from pistols to shotguns, but also guns that ricochet and guns that use smart targeting to home in on enemies. There are also a plethora of silent melee options, from katanas to hammers to… a large flesh-colored club you won’t want your mom to see you wielding. But you don’t have to do everything with your hands — in this world, everybody’s got a variety of hardware built into their body somewhere, and you can use yours to hack theirs. You start with simple options, but by the end of the game, if you’ve bought the upgrades, you’ll be locking your enemies in place, blinding them, and non-lethally zapping them into unconsciousness two at a time all while getting critical headshots with your pistol. For me, normal difficulty was just enough to make me feel great when I did cool things while still presenting plenty of evidence that I was not unstoppable.',\n",
       "  'I used a PS4 controller on my PC, and the controls were mostly great when it counted. I had no trouble running, hacking, and shooting, and when I drove a vehicle, my R2 “gas pedal” allowed me to choose my speed. As I got my hands on a few vehicles, I noticed how differently they handled, which I appreciate. I started the game as a Nomad, and I oversteered horribly when driving V’s original car, but the more Buick-like car I got later was easy to handle, and I loved weaving motorcycles through traffic. Sadly, I had to use a wire for my PS4 controller — I have the game via GoG Galaxy, which only appears to support wireless play for Xbox controllers — but I was playing on a laptop, so the wire wasn’t a real obstacle.'],\n",

The mission log itself is a big messy list with no clear indications of what different tasks will reward you with or which optional jobs might be more pertinent to V and Johnny’s story than others. It’s primarily broken into “Main Jobs” that are required to progress, “Gigs” that offer amusing but quick and inconsequential bites of action and story, and a “Side Jobs” category that basically houses everything else, be it an important but optional piece of plot, a date with a side character, or just a series of bare-knuckle boxing matches. What’s frustrating here is that since all these Side Jobs are clumped together and optional, at a certain point I was at a loss as to how else I could impact the larger story and see more endings.\n",

It feels weird to do throwaway fun stuff when you have a serious, ever-present threat to attend to, and in V's case, it just doesn't make sense to dally.\n",

      "You have more freedom to play the character you really want to during side activities, but main-story V has clearly defined priorities. I often couldn't find the character I'd been developing via side quests when I returned to the main plot--not in how I'd been shaping her personality as she reacted to events, nor in the hacker I built as she was forced into more traditional boss fights.\n",

Similarly, I was shocked to discover one of my favorite missions early on wasn’t even offered to another player because of a single decision we’d made differently. I was also floored when multiple decisions I made during a mission mere hours into the story massively changed the outcome of an unrelated one more than 25 hours later. I’d unwittingly turned what could have been an all-out gunfight into a friendly conversation.\n",
