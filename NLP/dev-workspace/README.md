## TODO

- ~~read at least one book about pre-bert NLP sentiment analysis (best: use nltk), learn about pre-processing.~~
- read one book about transformer sentiment analysus (using huggingface/pytorch, and best custom gpt-1/gpt-2/gpt-3). May require QLorA/QLorA for fine-tuning.

Ignore the [positive, neutral, negative] output (even okay with [positive, negative]) first. Utlimately we may use chatgpt-3.5 // chatgpt-4 to generate [positive, neutral, negative] label from reviews.
